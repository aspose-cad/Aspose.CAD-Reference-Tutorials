# Export to PDF with Aspose.CAD for Java

## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on exporting CAD files to PDF using Aspose.CAD for Java. If you're looking to seamlessly convert your CAD drawings to the widely supported PDF format, you're in the right place. In this step-by-step guide, we will break down the process, ensuring you understand each step to achieve successful PDF export.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for Java: Ensure you have the Aspose.CAD library installed in your Java environment. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

- Resource Directory: Set up a directory where your CAD files are stored. Replace "Your Document Directory" in the provided code snippet with the actual path.

Now, let's move on to the main steps.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces to enable the use of Aspose.CAD functionalities.

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.InterpolationMode;
import com.aspose.cad.SmoothingMode;
import com.aspose.cad.TextRenderingHint;

import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
//import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.TypeOfEntities;
```

## Step 1: Load CAD File

Load your CAD file into the Aspose.CAD Image object. Replace "site.dwf" with your actual CAD file name.

```java
String fileName = (dataDir + "site.dwf");
Image image = Image.load(fileName);
```

## Step 2: Configure PDF Options

Set up the PDF export options, including vector rasterization options such as page height, width, and layouts.

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);

rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(500);
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(500);
rasterizationOptions.setLayouts(new String[] { "Model" });
```

## Step 3: Export to PDF

Specify the output path for the generated PDF file and save the image with the configured PDF options.

```java
String outPath = dataDir + "site.pdf";
image.save(outPath, pdfOptions);
```

Congratulations! You have successfully exported your CAD file to a PDF using Aspose.CAD for Java.
