# Export AutoCAD Images to PDF - Aspose.CAD for Java Tutorial

## Introduction

Are you looking to seamlessly convert AutoCAD images to PDF using Java? Look no further! In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process using Aspose.CAD for Java, a powerful library that simplifies complex tasks. By the end, you'll have a grasp on exporting 3D images to PDF effortlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure you have a Java development environment set up on your system.
- Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).
- Document Directory: Create a directory to store your CAD files for easy access.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, import the necessary namespaces to utilize the functionality of Aspose.CAD for Java:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
//import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.TypeOfEntities;
```

Now, let's break down the example code into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Set the Resource Directory Path

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ExportingCAD/";
```

Ensure you replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your document directory.

## Step 2: Load the CAD Image

```java
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
Image cadImage = Image.load(srcFile);
```

Replace `"conic_pyramid.dxf"` with the name of your AutoCAD file.

## Step 3: Set Rasterization Options

```java
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(500);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(500);
// rasterizationOptions.setTypeOfEntities(TypeOfEntities.Entities3D);

rasterizationOptions.setLayouts(new String[] {"Model"});
```

Adjust the width, height, and layout settings based on your preferences.

## Step 4: Configure PDF Options

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
```

Set up PDF options, including vector rasterization settings.

## Step 5: Save the PDF

```java
cadImage.save(dataDir + "Export3DImagestoPDF_out_.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

Specify the output directory and file name for the generated PDF.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to export AutoCAD images to PDF using Aspose.CAD for Java. This user-friendly guide simplifies a complex process, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.
