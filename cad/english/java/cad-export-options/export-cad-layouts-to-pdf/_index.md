# Export CAD Layouts to PDF with Aspose.CAD for Java

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving field of computer-aided design (CAD), Aspose.CAD for Java stands out as a powerful tool for manipulating and converting CAD files. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of exporting CAD layouts to PDF using Aspose.CAD for Java. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just diving into the world of CAD, this step-by-step guide will help you harness the full potential of this versatile Java library.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for Java: Ensure that you have the library installed. You can download it from the Aspose website [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.

Now that you have everything set up, let's get started with the tutorial.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java code, start by importing the necessary namespaces. These imports provide access to the classes and methods needed for working with Aspose.CAD for Java.

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.InterpolationMode;
import com.aspose.cad.SmoothingMode;
import com.aspose.cad.TextRenderingHint;

import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
//import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.TypeOfEntities;
```

## Step 1: Load the CAD File

Begin by loading the CAD file into your Java application using the `Image.load` method. Replace `"conic_pyramid.dxf"` with the path to your CAD file.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ExportingCAD/";
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
Image cadImage = Image.load(srcFile);
```

## Step 2: Set Rasterization Options

Create an instance of `CadRasterizationOptions` to define how the CAD entities should be rasterized. Adjust parameters such as page width, page height, and layout scaling according to your requirements.

```java
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setAutomaticLayoutsScaling(true);
rasterizationOptions.setNoScaling(false);
rasterizationOptions.setContentAsBitmap(true);
rasterizationOptions.setLayouts(new String[]{"Model"});
```

## Step 3: Set PDF Options

Create an instance of `PdfOptions` and associate it with the rasterization options. Additionally, set graphics options for the PDF export, such as smoothing mode, text rendering hint, and interpolation mode.

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
rasterizationOptions.getGraphicsOptions().setSmoothingMode(SmoothingMode.HighQuality);
rasterizationOptions.getGraphicsOptions().setTextRenderingHint(TextRenderingHint.AntiAliasGridFit);
rasterizationOptions.getGraphicsOptions().setInterpolationMode(InterpolationMode.HighQualityBicubic);
```

## Step 4: Export to PDF

Finally, export the CAD layouts to a PDF file using the `save` method of the `cadImage` object.

```java
cadImage.save(dataDir + "CADLayoutsToPDF_out_.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

Congratulations! You have successfully exported CAD layouts to PDF using Aspose.CAD for Java. Feel free to explore additional features and functionalities offered by Aspose.CAD to enhance your CAD file manipulation experience.
