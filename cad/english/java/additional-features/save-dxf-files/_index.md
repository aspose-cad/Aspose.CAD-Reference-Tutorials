# Save DXF Files with Aspose.CAD In Java

## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive tutorial on saving DXF files using Aspose.CAD for Java. If you're looking to efficiently manage DXF files in your Java applications, you've come to the right place. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process step by step, ensuring that you grasp each concept thoroughly.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine.
- Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Download and integrate the Aspose.CAD library into your Java project. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).
- Document Directory: Set up a directory where you want to store and manage your CAD files.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, import the necessary namespaces into your Java code. This step is crucial for accessing the functionalities provided by Aspose.CAD for Java.

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Color;
import com.aspose.cad.Image;


import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
import java.io.File;
```

Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps for a clearer understanding:

## Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
```

Ensure you've imported the required classes from Aspose.CAD for Java to work with CAD files.

## Step 2: Set Up Document Directory

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "CADConversion/";
```

Replace "Your Document Directory" with the path to the directory where you want to save your DXF files.

## Step 3: Specify Source DXF File

```java
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
```

Set the path to your source DXF file. In this example, it's named "conic_pyramid.dxf."

## Step 4: Load CAD Image

```java
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.load(srcFile);
```

Load the CAD image using the Aspose.CAD library, casting it as a CadImage.

## Step 5: Save the DXF File

```java
cadImage.save(dataDir+"conic.dxf");
```

Save the modified CAD image to the specified directory with a new name, in this case, "conic.dxf."

Repeat these steps as needed for your specific application, and you'll be on your way to efficiently saving DXF files using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to save DXF files using Aspose.CAD for Java. This guide provides a solid foundation for integrating CAD file management into your Java applications.
