# Add Custom Properties to DWG Files Using Aspose.CAD In Java

In the world of Java programming, manipulating DWG files with custom properties is a common task. Aspose.CAD for Java provides a powerful set of tools to seamlessly integrate this functionality into your projects. In this step-by-step tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of adding custom properties to DWG files using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Introduction

Aspose.CAD for Java is a robust Java library that allows developers to work with CAD files effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll focus on enhancing DWG files by adding custom properties. These properties can be crucial for organizing, categorizing, and retrieving information from your CAD drawings.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your machine.
- Aspose.CAD for Java: Download and install the Aspose.CAD for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, include the necessary namespaces to access the functionality of Aspose.CAD. Add the following lines to your code:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;

import java.util.Map;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE and add Aspose.CAD for Java to your project dependencies.

## Step 2: Define File Paths

Define the paths for your source and output DWG files. For example:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "DXFDrawings/";
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
String outFile = dataDir + "AddCustomProperties_out.dxf";
```

## Step 3: Load the DWG File

Load the DWG file using Aspose.CAD for Java:

```java
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.load(srcFile);
```

## Step 4: Add Custom Properties

Add custom properties to the DWG file header:

```java
cadImage.getHeader().getCustomProperties().put("CUSTOM_PROPERTY_1", "Custom property test 1");
cadImage.getHeader().getCustomProperties().put("CUSTOM_PROPERTY_2", "Custom property test 2");
cadImage.getHeader().getCustomProperties().put("CUSTOM_PROPERTY_3", "Custom property test 3");
```

## Step 5: Save the Modified DWG File

Save the modified DWG file with added custom properties:

```java
cadImage.save(outFile);
```

## Step 6: Execute the Code

Run your Java program, and if there are no errors, you've successfully added custom properties to your DWG file.

```java
System.out.println("\nAddCustomProperties executed successfully.");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to enhance DWG files by adding custom properties using Aspose.CAD for Java. This capability can significantly improve the organization and retrieval of information within your CAD drawings.
