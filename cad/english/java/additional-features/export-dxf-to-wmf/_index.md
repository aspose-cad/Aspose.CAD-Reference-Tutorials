## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on using Aspose.CAD for Java to export DXF drawings to WMF format. Aspose.CAD is a powerful Java library that provides extensive capabilities for working with CAD files. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of converting DXF files to WMF format using Aspose.CAD.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for Java: Ensure that you have the Aspose.CAD library integrated into your Java project. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

- Document Directory: Set up a document directory where your DXF drawings are stored.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, import the necessary namespaces to access the functionalities provided by Aspose.CAD:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Color;
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.ifc.IfcImage;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.WmfOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load DXF Drawing

Load the DXF drawing that you want to export to WMF format. Ensure that the path to the DXF file is correctly specified.

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "DXFDrawings/";
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
Image image = Image.load(srcFile);
```

## Step 2: Configure Rasterization Options

Configure rasterization options to define the output page width and height. In this example, we set the page width and height to 100 units.

```java
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(100);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(100);
WmfOptions wmfOptions = new WmfOptions();
```

## Step 3: Save as WMF

Save the loaded DXF drawing as WMF format using the configured options.

```java
cadImage.save(dataDir+" example.ifc.wmf", wmfOptions);
```

## Step 4: Dispose of Resources

Dispose of the resources to free up memory and ensure efficient resource management.

```java
finally
{
  cadImage.dispose();
}
```

## Step 5: Export to PDF

Optionally, export the DXF drawing to PDF format using Aspose.CAD.

```java
image.save(dataDir + "conic_pyramid_out_.pdf"); 
```

Congratulations! You have successfully exported a DXF drawing to WMF format using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the process of using Aspose.CAD for Java to export DXF drawings to WMF format. With its comprehensive features and ease of use, Aspose.CAD provides a reliable solution for working with CAD files in Java projects.
