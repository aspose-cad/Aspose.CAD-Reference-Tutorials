# Enable Tracking in DWG Files Using Aspose.CAD In Java

## Introduction

In the realm of computer-aided design (CAD), Aspose.CAD for Java stands out as a powerful tool that empowers developers to manipulate and convert CAD files with ease. This tutorial delves into a specific functionality of Aspose.CAD for Java â€“ enabling tracking in DWG files. Tracking changes in DWG files is crucial for collaborative design projects, ensuring seamless communication and efficient workflow. In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to enable tracking using Java, leveraging the capabilities of Aspose.CAD.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.
- Aspose.CAD for Java: Download and install Aspose.CAD for Java from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).
- Document Directory: Prepare a directory where your DWG files are located.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, start by importing the necessary namespaces to leverage Aspose.CAD functionalities:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRenderResult;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.RenderResult;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
```

## Step 1: Load the DWG File

Begin by loading the DWG file into your Java application. Adjust the file path accordingly:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "DXFDrawings/";
Image image = Image.load(dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf");
```

## Step 2: Configure PDF Export Options

Configure the PDF export options, specifying vector rasterization options for CAD:

```java
OutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "output_conic_pyramid.pdf");
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
CadRasterizationOptions cadRasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(cadRasterizationOptions);
cadRasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(800);
cadRasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(600);
```

## Step 3: Implement Tracking

Implement tracking using a custom error handler class. This class will handle tracking results and display any encountered problems:

```java
cadRasterizationOptions.RenderResult = new ErrorHandler();
```

## Step 4: Export to PDF

Initiate the export process to convert the DWG file to a PDF with tracking enabled:

```java
System.out.println("Exporting to pdf format");
image.save(stream, pdfOptions);
```

## Step 5: CadRenderHandler Class

Define the `CadRenderHandler` class to handle rendering results, displaying tracking information:

```java
public static class ErrorHandler extends CadRasterizationOptions.CadRenderHandler {
    @Override
    public void invoke(CadRenderResult result) {
        System.out.println("Tracking results of exporting");

        if (result.isRenderComplete())
            return;

        System.out.println("Have some problems:");

        int idxError = 1;
        for (RenderResult rr : result.getFailures()) {
            System.out.printf("{0}. {1}, {2}", idxError, rr.getRenderCode(), rr.getMessage());
            idxError++;
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Enabling tracking in DWG files using Aspose.CAD for Java is a seamless process that enhances collaboration in CAD projects. By following these steps, you can efficiently implement tracking functionality, ensuring smooth communication and error handling.
