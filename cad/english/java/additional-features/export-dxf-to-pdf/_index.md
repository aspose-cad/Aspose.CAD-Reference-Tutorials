# Export DXF Drawing to PDF with Aspose.CAD for Java

## Introduction

In the world of Java development, Aspose.CAD is a powerful tool that enables seamless manipulation and conversion of CAD drawings. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of exporting DXF drawings to PDF using Aspose.CAD for Java. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the entire procedure, ensuring you grasp each concept thoroughly.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
- Aspose.CAD for Java: Download and install Aspose.CAD for Java from [this link](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, start by importing the necessary namespaces:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Color;
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
```

## Step 1: Set the Resource Directory

Begin by setting the path to the resource directory where your DXF drawings are stored.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "DXFDrawings/";
```

## Step 2: Load the DXF Drawing

Load the DXF drawing using the `Image.load` method.

```java
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
Image image = Image.load(srcFile);
```

## Step 3: Create Rasterization Options

Create an instance of `CadRasterizationOptions` and configure its properties.

```java
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setBackgroundColor(Color.getWhite());
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);
```

## Step 4: Create PDF Options

Create an instance of `PdfOptions` and set the `VectorRasterizationOptions` property.

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
```

## Step 5: Export DXF to PDF

Finally, export the DXF drawing to PDF using the `image.save` method.

```java
image.save(dataDir + "conic_pyramid_out_.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

Repeat these steps for your specific DXF drawings, adjusting the file paths accordingly.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to export DXF drawings to PDF using Aspose.CAD for Java. This powerful tool opens up a world of possibilities for CAD manipulation within your Java projects.
