## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.CAD for Java, a powerful library that empowers developers to manipulate CAD drawings with ease. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer to the CAD realm, this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of exporting CAD drawings to SVG format using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
- Aspose.CAD Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).
- Document Directory: Create a directory for your CAD drawings, and note its path.

## Import Namespaces

In this step, we'll import the necessary namespaces to kickstart our Aspose.CAD journey. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open Your Java Project
Open your Java project in the IDE of your choice.

### Step 2: Add Aspose.CAD Library
Add the Aspose.CAD library to your project. You can do this by including the JAR file in your project's dependencies.

### Step 3: Import Namespaces
In your Java class, import the required namespaces:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.SvgOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.SvgColorMode;
```

## Export to SVG

Now that we've set the stage, let's dive into the step-by-step process of exporting CAD drawings to SVG using Aspose.CAD for Java.

### Step 1: Specify the Resource Directory

Define the path to your resource directory, where your CAD drawings are located:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "DWGDrawings/";
```

### Step 2: Load the CAD Drawing

Load the CAD drawing using the Aspose.CAD library:

```java
Image image = Image.load(dataDir + "meshes.dwg");
```

### Step 3: Configure SVG Export Options

Configure the SVG export options to customize the output:

```java
SvgOptions options = new SvgOptions();
options.setColorType(SvgColorMode.Grayscale);
options.setTextAsShapes(true);
```

### Step 4: Save as SVG

Save the CAD drawing as an SVG file:

```java
image.save(dataDir + "meshes.svg");
```

Congratulations! You've successfully exported a CAD drawing to SVG using Aspose.CAD for Java.
