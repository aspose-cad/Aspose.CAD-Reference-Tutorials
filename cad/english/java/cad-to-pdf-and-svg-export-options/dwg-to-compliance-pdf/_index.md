# DWG to Compliance PDF Using Aspose.CAD for Java

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of digital design, the need to convert DWG drawings to compliance PDF formats is crucial for seamless collaboration and standardized documentation. Aspose.CAD for Java emerges as a powerful tool, offering efficiency and precision in this process. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to utilize Aspose.CAD for Java to effortlessly convert DWG files to compliant PDFs, ensuring adherence to PDF/A1a and PDF/A1b standards.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have a working Java development environment set up on your system.
- Aspose.CAD Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD library for Java from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).
- Document Directory: Create a directory to store your DWG drawings.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, import the necessary namespaces to access the functionalities of Aspose.CAD. Add the following lines at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfCompliance;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfDocumentOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
```

## Step 1: Set the Resource Directory

Define the path to your resource directory where the DWG drawings are stored.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "DWGDrawings/";
```

## Step 2: Load the DWG File

Load the DWG file using the Aspose.CAD library.

```java
String srcFile = dataDir + "Bottom_plate.dwg";
Image objImage = Image.load(srcFile);
```

## Step 3: Create PDF Options

Create an instance of PdfOptions and set the vector rasterization options.

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(new CadRasterizationOptions());
```

## Step 4: Set Core PDF Options

Set the core PDF options, specifying the compliance standard (PDF/A1a or PDF/A1b).

```java
pdfOptions.setCorePdfOptions(new PdfDocumentOptions());
pdfOptions.getCorePdfOptions().setCompliance(PdfCompliance.PdfA1a);
```

## Step 5: Save PDF with Compliance A1a

Save the PDF file with compliance A1a.

```java
objImage.save(dataDir + "Saved1.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

## Step 6: Change Compliance to A1b

Change the compliance to PDF/A1b and save the PDF.

```java
pdfOptions.getCorePdfOptions().setCompliance(PdfCompliance.PdfA1b);
objImage.save(dataDir + "Saved.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

Repeat these steps for each DWG file you want to convert.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Aspose.CAD for Java provides a robust solution for converting DWG files to compliance PDFs. By following this step-by-step guide, you can streamline the conversion process and ensure that your documents adhere to industry standards.
