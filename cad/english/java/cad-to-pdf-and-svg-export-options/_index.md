## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** *Can I convert large DWG files to PDF/A without running out of memory?*  
A: Yes. Use the `CadImage` class with streaming options and dispose of images promptly to keep memory usage low.

**Q:** *Is it possible to export only a specific layout from a CAD file to SVG?*  
A: Absolutely. Load the desired layout by name and call the `Save` method with SVG options.

**Q:** *Do I need a separate license for each output format?*  
A: No. A single Aspose.CAD for Java license covers all supported export formats.

**Q:** *Can I batch‑process multiple CAD files in one run?*  
A: Yes. Iterate over a file collection, loading each with `CadImage.load` and saving to the target format.

**Q:** *What if my CAD file contains raster images—are they preserved in PDF?*  
A: Raster images are embedded automatically when you export to PDF, maintaining visual fidelity.
