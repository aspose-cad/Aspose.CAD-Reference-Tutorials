## Introduction

In the dynamic world of computer-aided design (CAD), efficiency is key. Aspose.CAD for Java provides a robust set of tools to enhance your CAD workflow. One of the standout features is Auto Layout Scaling, a functionality that ensures your layouts are seamlessly adjusted for optimal display. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement Auto Layout Scaling step by step using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Ensure you have the Aspose.CAD for Java library installed. If not, you can download it from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

2. Resource Directory: Set up a directory to store your CAD documents. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path in the code snippet provided.

3. CAD File: Have a CAD file ready for testing. In this tutorial, we'll use a sample file named "conic_pyramid.dxf."

## Import Namespaces

In your Java code, import the necessary namespaces for Aspose.CAD functionality:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the CAD File

```java
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
Image image = Image.load(srcFile);
```

## Step 2: Create Rasterization Options

```java
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);
```

## Step 3: Set Auto Layout Scaling

```java
rasterizationOptions.setAutomaticLayoutsScaling(true);
```

## Step 4: Create PDF Options

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
```

## Step 5: Export to PDF

```java
image.save(dataDir + "result_out_.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

Repeat these steps for a seamless integration of Auto Layout Scaling into your CAD projects.

## Conclusion

Aspose.CAD for Java simplifies the implementation of Auto Layout Scaling, enhancing the adaptability of your CAD layouts. By following this step-by-step guide, you can seamlessly integrate this feature into your projects, ensuring optimal display and efficiency.
