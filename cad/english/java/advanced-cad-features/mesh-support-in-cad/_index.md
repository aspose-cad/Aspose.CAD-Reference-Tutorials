# Mesh Support with Aspose.CAD for Java

## Introduction

Aspose.CAD for Java is a powerful library that enables developers to work seamlessly with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files in Java applications. In this tutorial, we will explore the mesh support feature in Aspose.CAD for Java, allowing you to convert CAD files with meshes to PDF format. Follow the step-by-step guide below to harness the capabilities of this library and enhance your CAD file handling.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.

- Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

- Document with Meshes: Have a CAD document containing meshes ready for conversion. You can use the provided sample code with a file named "meshes.dwg."

## Import Namespaces

In your Java code, include the necessary namespaces to access the Aspose.CAD classes and methods. Add the following import statements:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

Create a new Java project and import the Aspose.CAD library. Set the project directory as the `dataDir`.

## Step 2: Define File Paths

Define the paths for the source CAD file (`meshes.dwg`) and the output PDF file (`meshes.pdf`).

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "CADConversion/";
String sourceFilePath = dataDir + "meshes.dwg";
String outPath = dataDir + "meshes.pdf";
```

## Step 3: Load the CAD Image

Load the CAD image using the `Image.load` method and cast it to `CadImage`.

```java
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.load(sourceFilePath);
```

## Step 4: Configure Rasterization Options

Configure rasterization options to set page dimensions and layouts for the PDF output.

```java
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setLayouts(new String[] { "Model" });
```

## Step 5: Set PDF Options

Set PDF options, including vector rasterization options.

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
```

## Step 6: Save the PDF

Save the CAD image as a PDF using the specified options.

```java
cadImage.save(outPath, pdfOptions);
```

Follow these steps carefully to seamlessly convert CAD files with meshes to PDF using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Aspose.CAD for Java provides robust support for handling CAD files, including mesh support. By following this tutorial, you can effortlessly convert CAD files containing meshes to PDF format, enhancing your document conversion capabilities.
