## Introduction

In the dynamic world of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), efficient file conversion is crucial for seamless collaboration and communication. Aspose.CAD for Java emerges as a powerful tool, offering robust capabilities for converting CAD files to PDF and TIFF formats. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of setting background and drawing color using Aspose.CAD for Java, providing you with a step-by-step guide for optimal results.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.CAD for Java library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

- Document Directory: Have a dedicated directory for your CAD files. Replace `"Your Document Directory" + "CADConversion/"` with the path to your directory.

Now, let's dive into the process.

## Import Namespaces

Ensure you import the necessary namespaces to leverage the functionalities of Aspose.CAD for Java. In our example, we use the following:

```java
import java.awt.Color;
import java.awt.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadDrawTypeMode;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.tiff.enums.TiffExpectedFormat;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.TiffOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load CAD File

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "CADConversion/";
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
Image objImage = Image.load(srcFile);
```

## Step 2: Set Background and Drawing Color

```java
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setBackgroundColor(com.aspose.cad.Color.getBeige());
rasterizationOptions.setDrawType(CadDrawTypeMode.UseDrawColor);
rasterizationOptions.setBackgroundColor(com.aspose.cad.Color.getBlue());
```

## Step 3: Create PDF and Save

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
objImage.save(dataDir + "result_out_.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

## Step 4: Create TIFF and Save

```java
TiffOptions tiffOptions = new TiffOptions(TiffExpectedFormat.Default);
tiffOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
objImage.save(dataDir + "result_out_.tiff", tiffOptions);
```

Follow these steps diligently to achieve optimal results in CAD to PDF and TIFF conversion using Aspose.CAD for Java.
