## Introduction

In the realm of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Aspose.CAD for Java stands out as a powerful tool for rendering and processing CAD files. This tutorial will guide you through the process of enabling tracking for CAD rendering, enhancing your control over the transformation from CAD files to PDF format.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tracking setup, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

2. Aspose.CAD Library: Download and integrate the Aspose.CAD library into your Java project. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

3. Document Directory: Prepare a directory to store your CAD files.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, import the necessary namespaces to leverage Aspose.CAD functionalities. Add the following lines at the beginning of your code:

```java
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;

import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
```

## Step 1: Set the Resource Directory Path

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "CADConversion/";
```

Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path to your document directory.

## Step 2: Load the CAD File

```java
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
Image image = Image.load(srcFile);
```

Specify the path to your CAD file, ensuring it's within the designated document directory.

## Step 3: Set PDF Output Options

```java
OutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "conic_pyramid.pdf");
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
```

Create an output stream and set PDF options for the conversion.

## Step 4: Configure CadRasterizationOptions

```java
CadRasterizationOptions cadRasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(cadRasterizationOptions);
cadRasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(800);
cadRasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(600);
```

Instantiate `CadRasterizationOptions` and customize vector rasterization options according to your preferences.

## Step 5: Save the PDF File

```java
image.save(stream, pdfOptions);
```

Save the rendered PDF file with the specified options.

## Step 6: Verify Tracking Enablement

```java
System.out.println("Tracking enabled successfully for CAD rendering process.");
```

Confirm that tracking is successfully enabled for the CAD rendering process.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully enabled tracking for CAD rendering using Aspose.CAD for Java. This step-by-step guide empowers you to seamlessly convert CAD files to PDF with enhanced control and tracking capabilities.
