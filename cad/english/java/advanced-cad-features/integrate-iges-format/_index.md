# Integrate IGES Format

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of CAD (Computer-Aided Design), the need to integrate various file formats is paramount. This guide dives into the seamless integration of IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification) format using Aspose.CAD for Java. Aspose.CAD empowers developers to manipulate and convert CAD files effortlessly, opening up a world of possibilities for application development.

## Prerequisites

Before embarking on this integration journey, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Aspose.CAD for Java operates in a Java environment, so make sure you have the latest JDK installed.

- Aspose.CAD Library: Download and integrate the Aspose.CAD library into your project. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

- Document Directory: Set up a directory to store your CAD documents. Adjust the `dataDir` variable in the example code to point to your document directory.

## Import Namespaces

In the tutorial example, several namespaces are crucial for integrating IGES format. Ensure that you import the necessary namespaces at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the IGES File

```java
String sourceFilePath = dataDir + "figa2.igs";
Image igesImage = Image.load(sourceFilePath);
```

Here, we load the IGES file into the Aspose.CAD framework, setting the source file path accordingly.

## Step 2: Set Up Output Path and PDF Options

```java
String outPath = dataDir + "meshes.pdf";
PdfOptions pdf = new PdfOptions();
CadRasterizationOptions vectorOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
vectorOptions.setPageHeight(1000);
vectorOptions.setPageWidth(1000);
pdf.setVectorRasterizationOptions(vectorOptions);
```

Define the output path for the PDF file and configure the PDF options for vector rasterization.

## Step 3: Save the Resulting PDF

```java
igesImage.save(outPath, pdf);
```

Save the processed IGES file in PDF format using the specified options. The resulting PDF will now contain the integrated IGES format.

## Conclusion

Integrating IGES format using Aspose.CAD for Java opens up a myriad of possibilities in CAD development. This guide has provided a clear, step-by-step approach to seamlessly merge IGES files into your applications, ensuring efficiency and flexibility.
