# Export DWG to PDF and Convert CAD Drawings

## Introduction

Unlock the full potential of your CAD drawings with Aspose.CAD for Java. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out, our step‑by‑step tutorials will guide you through seamless **export dwg to pdf** conversions, raster image generation, and other common CAD manipulation tasks. You’ll discover how to convert DWG to raster, export specific layouts, and even turn DWT files into DXF—all with clean Java code and no external dependencies.

## Quick Answers
- **What is the easiest way to export DWG to PDF in Java?** Use Aspose.CAD’s `PdfOptions` together with the `Image.save` method.  
- **Can I convert a DWG file directly to a raster image?** Yes, Aspose.CAD supports conversion to PNG, JPEG, BMP, and more.  
- **Is it possible to export only a single layout from a DWG?** Absolutely—select the layout by name or index before saving.  
- **Do I need a license for production use?** A commercial license is required for production; a free trial is available for evaluation.  
- **Which secondary formats are supported?** Besides PDF, you can export to raster formats, DXF, and other CAD‑compatible types.

## What is “export dwg to pdf”?

Exporting a DWG file to PDF creates a device‑independent, share‑ready document that preserves the exact visual fidelity of the original drawing. This is especially useful for client reviews, documentation, or archiving where the recipient may not have CAD software installed.

## Why use Aspose.CAD for Java?

- **No external CAD software required** – all processing happens inside your Java application.  
- **High‑quality rendering** – vector‑to‑raster conversion retains line weights, layers, and colors.  
- **Full format support** – DWG, DWF, DWT, DXF, and many raster outputs.  
- **Thread‑safe API** – suitable for server‑side batch processing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I export a DWG file to PDF without losing layer information?**  
A: Use `PdfOptions` and set `PdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationMode(VectorRasterizationMode.Vector)` to retain vector data, then call `image.save("output.pdf", options);`.

**Q: Can I batch‑process multiple DWG files to PDF in one run?**  
A: Yes—loop through your file collection, load each with `Image.load`, and save using the same PDF options.

**Q: Is there a way to convert a DWT template directly to DXF?**  
A: Absolutely. Load the DWT with `Image.load` and save it as DXF using `image.save("output.dxf");`.

**Q: What Java versions are supported by Aspose.CAD?**  
A: The library works with Java 8 and newer, including Java 11, 17, and later LTS releases.

**Q: Do I need a separate license for PDF export?**
