# Substitute Font of a Particular Style in DWG Using Aspose.CAD for Java

## Introduction

In the world of CAD (Computer-Aided Design), precision and detail are paramount. Aspose.CAD for Java emerges as a powerful tool to manipulate CAD drawings, providing extensive functionalities for developers. One such essential feature is the ability to substitute fonts within a DWG file, ensuring consistency and customization.

In this step-by-step guide, we'll delve into how to substitute the font of a particular style in a DWG file using Aspose.CAD for Java. Before we dive into the details, let's ensure you have the prerequisites in place.

## Prerequisites

Before you embark on this tutorial, make sure you have the following set up:

1. Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD library. You can find the library and its documentation [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

2. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine.

Now that you have the necessary tools, let's proceed to the next section.

## Import Namespaces

In Java, importing the right namespaces is crucial for utilizing external libraries. In this case, ensure you import the necessary Aspose.CAD namespaces. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;

```

Now, let's break down the example code into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Set the Resource Directory

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "CADConversion/";
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your actual document directory.

## Step 2: Load the CAD Drawing

```java
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";

// Load a CAD drawing in an instance of CadImage
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.load(srcFile);
```

Make sure to replace `"conic_pyramid.dxf"` with the actual name of your CAD drawing.

## Step 3: Specify Font for a Style

```java
// Specify the font for one particular style
((CadStyleTableObject)cadImage.getStyles().get_Item(0)).setPrimaryFontName("Arial");
```

Adjust the font name ("Arial" in this example) as per your requirements.

Now you have successfully substituted the font of a particular style in your DWG file using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Conclusion

Aspose.CAD for Java opens up possibilities for CAD manipulation, and font substitution is just one of its many features. Experiment with different styles and fonts to achieve the desired look and feel in your CAD drawings.
