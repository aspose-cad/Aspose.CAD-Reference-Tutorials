## Introduction

In the dynamic realm of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), enhancing the visual appeal of drawings is often crucial. One effective way to achieve this is by substituting fonts within DWG files. Aspose.CAD for Java emerges as a powerful tool in this domain, providing a seamless solution to font substitution. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process step by step, demonstrating how to substitute fonts in a DWG file using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before delving into the font substitution magic, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Environment: Make sure you have a functional Java environment installed on your machine.
- Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD library from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).
- Sample DWG File: Have a DWG file ready for experimentation. If you don't have one, you can find samples on various CAD resources.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, import the necessary namespaces to access Aspose.CAD functionalities. This step is crucial for establishing a connection with the Aspose.CAD library.

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadtables.CadStyleTableObject;
```

## Font Substitution in DWG

### Step 1: Load Your DWG File

Begin by loading the DWG file into your Java project using the Aspose.CAD library.

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "CADConversion/";

String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage) Image.load(srcFile);
```

### Step 2: Iterate Over Styles

Iterate over the styles within the CAD drawing using a loop. This allows you to access and modify individual styles.

```java
for(Object style : cadImage.getStyles())
{
    // Set the font name
    ((com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadtables.CadStyleTableObject)style).setPrimaryFontName("Arial");
}
```

### Step 3: Save Changes

After substituting the fonts, ensure to save the changes to your DWG file.

```java
cadImage.save(dataDir + "output.dwg", new DwgOptions());
```

By following these steps, you successfully substitute fonts in a DWG file, transforming the visual presentation of your CAD document.

## Conclusion

Incorporating font substitutions in your CAD drawings brings a new dimension to visual aesthetics. Aspose.CAD for Java simplifies this process, providing a user-friendly interface for font manipulation within DWG files. Experiment with different fonts to achieve the desired impact on your designs.
