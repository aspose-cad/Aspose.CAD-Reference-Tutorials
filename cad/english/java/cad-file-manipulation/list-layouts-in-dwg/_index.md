# List Layouts in DWG Using Aspose.CAD for Java

## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on using Aspose.CAD for Java to list layouts in DWG files. Aspose.CAD is a powerful library that enables developers to work with CAD files programmatically. In this tutorial, we'll focus on a specific task: listing layouts in a DWG file. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to seamlessly integrate this functionality into your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.CAD library for Java installed. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

- Java Development Environment: Set up a Java development environment on your machine.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java application, you need to import the necessary namespaces to use Aspose.CAD. Add the following lines at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadLayoutDictionary;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.CadLayout;
```

## Step 1: Set up Your Document Directory

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "CADConversion/";
```

Ensure to replace "Your Document Directory" with the path to the directory where your CAD files are stored.

## Step 2: Load the DWG File

```java
String sourceFilePath = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
Image image = Image.load(sourceFilePath);
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)image;
```

Load the DWG file using the specified file path.

## Step 3: Get Layouts and Print Names

```java
CadLayoutDictionary layouts = cadImage.getLayouts();
for (CadLayout layout : layouts.getValues())
{
    System.out.println("Layout " + layout.getLayoutName());
}
```

Retrieve the layouts from the DWG file and print their names to the console.
