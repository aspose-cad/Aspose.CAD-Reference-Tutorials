# Add Attributes to MText in DWG Files Using Aspose.CAD for Java

## Introduction

In the world of Java programming, manipulating CAD files is a common task. Aspose.CAD for Java is a powerful library that facilitates the handling of CAD files, making it a go-to choice for developers. In this tutorial, we'll delve into a specific use case: adding attributes to MText in DWG files. This can be crucial for enhancing the richness of your CAD drawings.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, make sure you have the following:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.

- Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, import the necessary namespaces to access the functionalities of Aspose.CAD for Java. This includes:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Color;
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.CadBaseEntity;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadconsts.CadEntityTypeName;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
```

Now, let's break down the process of adding attributes to MText in DWG files into manageable steps.

## Step 1: Set the Path

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "DXFDrawings/";
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
```

## Step 2: Load CAD Image

```java
CadImage cadImage =(CadImage) Image.load(srcFile);
```

## Step 3: Initialize Lists for MText and Attributes

```java
List<CadBaseEntity>  mtextList = new ArrayList<CadBaseEntity>();
List<CadBaseEntity> attribList = new ArrayList<CadBaseEntity>();
```

## Step 4: Iterate Through Entities

```java
try
{
    for (CadBaseEntity entity : cadImage.getEntities())
    {
        if (entity.getTypeName() == CadEntityTypeName.MTEXT)
        {
            mtextList.add(entity);
        }

        if (entity.getTypeName() == CadEntityTypeName.INSERT)
        {
            for (CadBaseEntity childObject : entity.getChildObjects())
            {
                if (childObject.getTypeName() == CadEntityTypeName.ATTRIB)
                {
                    attribList.add(childObject);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    System.out.println("MText Size: "+ mtextList.size());
    System.out.println("Attribute Size: "+ attribList.size());
}
finally
{
    cadImage.dispose();
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've walked through the process of adding attributes to MText in DWG files using Aspose.CAD for Java. By following these steps, you can enhance the richness of your CAD drawings and tailor them to your specific needs.
