# Search Text in AutoCAD DWG File Using Aspose.CAD for Java

## Introduction

Are you a Java developer working with AutoCAD DWG files and looking to integrate a powerful text search functionality into your applications? Look no further! This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through the process of searching text in an AutoCAD DWG file using Aspose.CAD for Java. Aspose.CAD is a robust and feature-rich library that provides extensive support for working with CAD files, making it an excellent choice for your development needs.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have a working Java development environment set up on your machine.

2. Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD for Java library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/). You can also explore the comprehensive documentation at [Aspose.CAD Java Documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/java/).

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, import the necessary namespaces from the Aspose.CAD library to leverage its functionality. Add the following import statements to your code:

```java

import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadLayoutDictionary;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadconsts.CadEntityTypeName;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.CadBaseEntity;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.CadBlockEntity;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.CadInsertObject;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.CadMText;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.CadText;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.attentities.CadAttDef;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.attentities.CadAttrib;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadtables.CadBlockTableObject;
```

Now, let's break down the code into a series of steps to help you seamlessly integrate text search functionality into your Java application:

## Step 1: Load DWG File

```java
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage) CadImage.load(dataDir + "sample_file.dwg");
```

Load an existing DWG file as a `CadImage` object using the `load` method.

## Step 2: Search Text in Entities

```java
for (CadBaseEntity entity : cadImage.getEntities()) {
    IterateCADNodeEntities(entity);
}
```

Iterate through the entities in the DWG file and search for text using the `IterateCADNodeEntities` method.

## Step 3: Search Text in Block Entities

```java
for (CadBlockEntity blockEntity : cadImage.getBlockEntities().getValues()) {
    for (CadBaseEntity entity : blockEntity.getEntities()) {
        IterateCADNodeEntities(entity);
    }
}
```

Extend the search to block entities within the DWG file, ensuring a comprehensive text search.

## Step 4: Recursive Node Iteration

```java
private static void IterateCADNodeEntities(CadBaseEntity obj) {
    // Implementation details as per entity type
}
```

Implement a recursive function to iterate through nodes inside nodes, categorizing and processing each entity type accordingly.

The provided code handles various entity types, including text, multiline text, insert objects, attribute definitions, and attributes.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented text search functionality in an AutoCAD DWG file using Aspose.CAD for Java. This powerful library empowers Java developers to manipulate and extract data from CAD files seamlessly.
