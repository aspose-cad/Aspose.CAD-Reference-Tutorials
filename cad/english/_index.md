# Export DWG to PDF with Aspose.CAD – Mastering Graphic Design

Welcome to the Aspose.CAD Tutorials Listing Page, your gateway to unlocking the full potential of graphic design and CAD integration. In this guide you’ll discover how to **export DWG to PDF** quickly and reliably, plus see how the same API helps you **convert DWG to STL**, **extract text from CAD**, and handle broader **CAD file format conversion** scenarios. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting out, our step‑by‑step tutorials will give you the confidence to turn complex CAD files into polished, shareable outputs.

## Quick Answers
- **What is the easiest way to export DWG to PDF?** Use the Aspose.CAD `Image.Save` method with the PDF format option.  
- **Can I also convert DWG to STL in the same project?** Yes – the same library provides a direct `ExportToStl` call.  
- **Do I need a license for production use?** A commercial license is required for unlimited functionality; a free trial works for evaluation.  
- **Which .NET versions are supported?** .NET Framework 4.6+, .NET Core 3.1+, .NET 5/6/7.  
- **Is there built‑in support for extracting text from CAD drawings?** Absolutely – Aspose.CAD can read entity text and return it as strings.

## What is “export DWG to PDF”?
Exporting a DWG (AutoCAD drawing) to PDF means converting the vector‑based design into a widely‑compatible, page‑oriented document that preserves geometry, layers, and annotations. This is essential for sharing designs with stakeholders who may not have CAD software.

## Why use Aspose.CAD for export DWG to PDF?
- **No external dependencies** – pure .NET library, no AutoCAD installation required.  
- **High fidelity** – retains line weights, hatches, and hidden‑line removal.  
- **Batch processing** – convert dozens of files in a single loop.  
- **Cross‑platform** – works on Windows, Linux, and macOS via .NET Core.

## How to convert DWG to STL?
If you need to 3‑D‑print a model, converting DWG to STL is a common workflow. Aspose.CAD lets you call `Save` with the STL format, preserving 3‑D geometry while simplifying the mesh for printing.

## How to extract text from CAD?
Many engineering drawings embed part numbers, dimensions, or notes as text entities. Using Aspose.CAD you can iterate over `CadEntity` objects, filter for `TextString` types, and pull the raw strings for indexing or search.

## How to convert CAD to image?
For quick previews or thumbnails, you can render any CAD drawing to PNG, JPEG, or BMP. The same `Image.Save` method used for PDF also supports raster formats, letting you generate web‑ready images in seconds.

## CAD file format conversion overview
Aspose.CAD supports over 30 CAD formats, including DWG, DXF, DGN, and PLT. This breadth means you can **export 3D model to STL**, **convert DWG to PDF**, or **save to SVG** without juggling multiple SDKs.

## Export 3D model to STL
When working with 3‑D models, STL is the de‑facto format for additive manufacturing. Aspose.CAD’s `ExportToStl` routine automatically triangulates surfaces, giving you a ready‑to‑print file.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I export a large DWG file to PDF without running out of memory?**  
A: Yes. Use the `LoadOptions` to enable streaming and process the file page‑by‑page.

**Q: Does Aspose.CAD support batch conversion of multiple DWG files to PDF?**  
A: Absolutely. Loop through a directory and call `Image.Save` for each file – the library is thread‑safe.

**Q: How accurate is the text extraction from CAD drawings?**  
A: Text entities are read directly from the drawing database, preserving exact strings, fonts, and positions.

**Q: Is there a way to preserve layers when exporting to PDF?**  
A: Layers are maintained as optional PDF layers; you can toggle visibility via the `PdfSaveOptions`.

**Q: Can I convert DWG to STL for 3‑D printing directly from .NET?**  
A: Yes – call `image.Save("output.stl", new StlOptions())` to get a printable mesh.
