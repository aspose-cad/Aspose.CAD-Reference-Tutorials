## Introduction

In the dynamic world of .NET development, Aspose.CAD emerges as a powerful tool for handling Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files. If you're eager to enhance your skills in manipulating CAD drawings, this tutorial is your gateway. We'll delve into the intricacies of setting background and drawing colors using Aspose.CAD for .NET, providing you with a step-by-step guide that ensures clarity and effectiveness.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic understanding of .NET development.
- Installation of Aspose.CAD for .NET. If you haven't done this yet, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
- A sample CAD file for experimentation. You can find one in your document directory.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
```

## Step 1: Load the CAD File

Start by loading the CAD file you want to work with using the following code snippet:

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";

using (Image image = Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Your code for further processing goes here
}
```

## Step 2: Configure Rasterization Options

Create an instance of `CadRasterizationOptions` and set its properties for background and drawing color setup:

```csharp
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 1600;
rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 1600;
rasterizationOptions.BackgroundColor = Color.Beige;
rasterizationOptions.DrawType = CadDrawTypeMode.UseDrawColor;
rasterizationOptions.DrawColor = Color.Blue;
```

## Step 3: Export to PDF

Create an instance of `PdfOptions` and set the `VectorRasterizationOptions` property:

```csharp
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

// Export CAD to PDF
image.Save(MyDir + "result_out.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

## Step 4: Export to TIFF

Create an instance of `TiffOptions` and set the `VectorRasterizationOptions` property:

```csharp
TiffOptions tiffOptions = new TiffOptions(TiffExpectedFormat.Default);
tiffOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

// Export CAD to TIFF
image.Save(MyDir + "result_out.tiff", tiffOptions);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to set background and drawing colors in Aspose.CAD for .NET. This tutorial equips you with the skills to manipulate CAD files effortlessly.
