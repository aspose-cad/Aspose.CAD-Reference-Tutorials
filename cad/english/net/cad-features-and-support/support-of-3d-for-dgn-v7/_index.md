# Support of 3D for DGN V7 in Aspose.CAD for .NET

## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive tutorial on leveraging the support of 3D for DGN V7 in Aspose.CAD for .NET! Aspose.CAD is a powerful library that enables developers to work seamlessly with CAD files in their .NET applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore the steps to utilize 3D support for DGN V7, providing you with the knowledge to enhance your CAD-related projects.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET: Ensure that you have Aspose.CAD for .NET installed. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

- Development Environment: Set up a suitable development environment, such as Visual Studio, for .NET application development.

- Sample DGN File: Have a sample DGN file ready for testing. You can use the provided sample file "Nikon_D90_Camera.dgn."

Now, let's jump into the steps to achieve 3D support for DGN V7 using Aspose.CAD for .NET!

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET application, start by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Dgn;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

Ensure you have a document directory set up in your project. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory.

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Load the DGN File

Load the existing DGN file as a CadImage using the following code:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "Nikon_D90_Camera.dgn";
string outFile = MyDir + "Nikon_D90_Camera.dgn";

using (DgnImage dgnImage = (DgnImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Your code for further processing goes here
}
```

## Step 3: Configure PDF Export Options

Set up options for exporting to PDF, specifying vector rasterization options such as page dimensions, automatic layouts scaling, background color, and layouts to export.

```csharp
var options = new PdfOptions
{
    VectorRasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions
    {
        PageWidth = 1500,
        PageHeight = 1500,
        AutomaticLayoutsScaling = true,
        BackgroundColor = Color.Black,
        Layouts = new string[] { "1", "2", "3", "9" } // Only export specified views
    }
};
```

## Step 4: Save the Raster Image

Save the DGN file as a raster image with the configured options.

```csharp
dgnImage.Save(outFile, options);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully utilized Aspose.CAD for .NET to export a DGN file with 3D support to a raster image. This tutorial has equipped you with the essential steps to integrate this functionality into your CAD projects.
