# Substituting Fonts in Aspose.CAD for .NET

## Introduction

In the realm of CAD development using .NET, the ability to manipulate fonts is a crucial skill. Aspose.CAD for .NET provides a robust set of tools for this purpose, allowing developers to seamlessly substitute fonts within their CAD drawings. In this tutorial, we'll explore the process step by step, demonstrating how to achieve font substitution efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of .NET programming.
- Aspose.CAD for .NET installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
- A CAD drawing file for hands-on practice.

## Import Namespaces

Before getting started, import the necessary namespaces to access the Aspose.CAD functionalities in your .NET application.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadTables;
```

## Step 1: Load CAD Drawing

Begin by loading the CAD drawing into an instance of `CadImage`. Ensure you provide the correct path to your document directory.

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";

using (CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Aspose.CAD.Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Your code for further actions goes here
}
```

## Step 2: Iterate Over Styles

Next, iterate over the styles in the CAD drawing using a `foreach` loop. This allows you to access and manipulate individual font styles.

```csharp
foreach (CadStyleTableObject style in cadImage.Styles)
{
    // Your code for style manipulation goes here
}
```

## Step 3: Substitute Fonts Globally

To substitute fonts globally for all styles, set the `PrimaryFontName` property for each style to the desired font name, for example, "Arial".

```csharp
foreach (CadStyleTableObject style in cadImage.Styles)
{
    style.PrimaryFontName = "Arial";
}
```

## Step 4: Substitute Font by Style Name

If you want to substitute the font for a specific style, you can do so by checking the style name within the loop.

```csharp
foreach (CadStyleTableObject style in cadImage.Styles)
{
    if (style.StyleName == "Roman")
    {
        style.PrimaryFontName = "Arial";
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to substitute fonts in Aspose.CAD for .NET. This skill is valuable for customizing the appearance of CAD drawings according to your preferences.
