# Get Size of CAD Layout in Aspose.CAD for .NET

## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on getting the size of CAD layouts using Aspose.CAD for .NET. Aspose.CAD is a powerful library that enables developers to work with CAD files seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of retrieving the size of CAD layouts using practical examples and step-by-step instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.CAD library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.CAD for .NET download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

- Document Files: Prepare the CAD files you want to work with. This tutorial uses "conic_pyramid.dxf" and "Bottom_plate.dwg" as examples.

Now, let's get started!

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.CAD;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadConsts;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadObjects;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadTables;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Document Directory

Set the path to your document directory. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Specify CAD File Paths

Define an array of CAD file paths you want to analyze. In this example, we use "conic_pyramid.dxf" and "Bottom_plate.dwg."

```csharp
string[] sourceFilePaths = new[]
{
    MyDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf",
    MyDir + "Bottom_plate.dwg"
};
```

## Step 3: Iterate Through CAD Files

Iterate through each CAD file and retrieve the layout information.

```csharp
foreach (var sourceFilePath in sourceFilePaths)
{
    string extension = Path.GetExtension(sourceFilePath);
    using (CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Aspose.CAD.Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
    {
        // ... (continue to the next step)
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Get Non-Empty Layouts

Define a helper method to get non-empty layouts based on the CAD file type.

```csharp
private static List<string> GetNotEmptyLayouts(Image cadImage, string extension)
{
    // ... (continue to the next step)
}
```

## Step 5: Get Layouts for DWG Files

Implement logic to retrieve non-empty layouts for DWG files.

```csharp
private static List<string> GetNotEmptyLayoutsForDwg(CadImage cadImage)
{
    // ... (continue to the next step)
}
```

## Step 6: Get Layouts for DXF Files

Implement logic to retrieve non-empty layouts for DXF files.

```csharp
private static List<string> GetNotEmptyLayoutsForDxf(CadImage cadImage)
{
    // ... (continue to the next step)
}
```

## Step 7: Retrieve Layout Size and Save as Image

Complete the process of getting layout size and saving it as an image.

```csharp
foreach (string layout in layouts)
{
    // ... (continue to the next step)
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to get the size of CAD layouts using Aspose.CAD for .NET. This tutorial covered essential steps, from setting up your project to retrieving layout information and saving it as an image. Now you can incorporate this knowledge into your .NET applications for efficient CAD file manipulation.
