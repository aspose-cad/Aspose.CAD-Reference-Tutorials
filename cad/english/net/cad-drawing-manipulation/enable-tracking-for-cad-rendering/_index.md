# Enable Tracking for CAD Rendering in Aspose.CAD for .NET

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of software development, Aspose.CAD for .NET stands out as a robust solution for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) rendering. This powerful library empowers developers to create, manipulate, and render CAD files seamlessly in the .NET environment. In this tutorial, we'll delve into a crucial aspect of Aspose.CAD for .NETâ€”enabling tracking for CAD rendering.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tracking functionality, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET: Make sure you have Aspose.CAD for .NET installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

- Development Environment: Set up a suitable development environment, such as Visual Studio, and have a basic understanding of .NET programming.

- CAD File: Prepare a CAD file (e.g., "conic_pyramid.dxf") that you'll use for tracking in the rendering process.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, make sure to import the necessary namespaces for Aspose.CAD:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
using System.IO;
```

Now, let's break down the process of enabling tracking for CAD rendering into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Set Document Directory

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
```

Ensure to replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path to your document directory.

## Step 2: Load CAD File

```csharp
using (Image image = Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Further steps will be implemented here
}
```

Load the CAD file into the Aspose.CAD.Image object.

## Step 3: Create PDF Options

```csharp
MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
```

Set up a memory stream and initialize PDF options for rendering.

## Step 4: Configure Rasterization Options

```csharp
CadRasterizationOptions cadRasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = cadRasterizationOptions;
cadRasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 800;
cadRasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 600;
```

Create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and configure the rendering options, such as page width and height.

## Step 5: Save Rendered Image

```csharp
image.Save(stream, pdfOptions);
```

Save the rendered image to the memory stream.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully enabled tracking for CAD rendering in Aspose.CAD for .NET. This capability enhances your control and visibility over the rendering process.
