## Introduction

In the dynamic realm of CAD (Computer-Aided Design), precision and efficiency are paramount. Imagine a scenario where you need to locate specific text within DWG files. Aspose.CAD for .NET comes to the rescue, offering a robust solution to seamlessly search text in DWG files using C#. This tutorial will guide you through the process, ensuring you harness the full potential of Aspose.CAD for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.CAD for .NET: Ensure you have the library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.CAD website](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
- Document Directory: Organize your DWG files in a dedicated directory.

## Import Namespaces

In your C# project, import the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.CAD. Add the following namespaces to your code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadObjects;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadConsts;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadObjects.AttEntities;
```

## Step 1: Load DWG File

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "search.dwg";
using (CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Your code here
}
```

## Step 2: Search Text in Entities Section

```csharp
foreach (CadBaseEntity entity in cadImage.Entities)
{
    IterateCADNodes(entity);
}
```

## Step 3: Search Text in Block Section

```csharp
foreach (CadBlockEntity blockEntity in cadImage.BlockEntities.Values)
{
    foreach (CadBaseEntity entity in blockEntity.Entities)
    {
        IterateCADNodes(entity);
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Iterate through CAD Nodes

```csharp
private static void IterateCADNodes(CadBaseEntity obj)
{
    switch (obj.TypeName)
    {
        // Handle different entity types
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Export to PDF

```csharp
Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions();
// Configure rasterization options
rasterizationOptions.Layouts = new[] { "Layout1" };
Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.PdfOptions pdfOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
cadImage.Save(MyDir + "SearchText_out.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

## Conclusion

Aspose.CAD for .NET provides a seamless solution for searching text in DWG files, empowering developers to enhance their CAD applications. By following this tutorial, you've unlocked the capability to locate specific text within DWG files efficiently.
