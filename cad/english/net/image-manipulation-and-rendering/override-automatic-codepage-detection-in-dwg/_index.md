# Override Automatic Codepage Detection in DWG Files - Aspose.CAD Tutorial

## Introduction

Harnessing the full potential of Aspose.CAD for .NET opens up a world of possibilities for developers working with DWG files. In this tutorial, we'll delve into a specific aspect: overriding automatic codepage detection. Understanding and implementing this feature can significantly enhance your CAD file processing capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of C# and the .NET framework.
- Aspose.CAD for .NET installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
- Familiarity with DWG files and their structure.

## Import Namespaces

To kick things off, you need to import the necessary namespaces to ensure smooth integration with Aspose.CAD. Insert the following code at the beginning of your script:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
```

This sets the stage for seamless communication with Aspose.CAD functionalities.

## Step 1: Define Your Document Directory

Begin by specifying the directory where your DWG file is located. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your file:

```csharp
//ExStart:1
string SourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
//ExEnd:1
```

## Step 2: Override Automatic Codepage Detection

Now, let's focus on the core of this tutorial â€“ overriding automatic codepage detection in DWG files. Use the following code snippet as a template:

```csharp
//ExStart:1
using (CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(SourceDir + "SimpleEntites.dwg",
new LoadOptions()
{
	SpecifiedEncoding = CodePages.Japanese,
	SpecifiedMifEncoding = MifCodePages.Japanese,
	RecoverMalformedCifMif = false
}))
{
	// Perform export or other operations with cadImage
}
//ExEnd:1
Console.WriteLine("OverrideAutomaticCodePageDetectionDwg executed successfully");
```

This code snippet loads a DWG file (`SimpleEntites.dwg` in this example) and overrides the automatic codepage detection settings. Adjust the file name and encoding parameters based on your requirements.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully explored how to override automatic codepage detection in DWG files using Aspose.CAD for .NET. This powerful feature provides control and flexibility in handling diverse CAD file scenarios.
