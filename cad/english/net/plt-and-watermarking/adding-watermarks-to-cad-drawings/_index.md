## Introduction

Are you looking to enhance your CAD drawings by adding professional watermarks? Aspose.CAD for .NET provides a robust solution to seamlessly integrate watermarks into your CAD files. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of adding watermarks using Aspose.CAD, ensuring your drawings not only convey critical information but also carry your unique mark.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:
- Aspose.CAD for .NET: Ensure you have the Aspose.CAD library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
- Your Document Directory: Set up a directory to store your CAD drawings.
Now, let's get started with adding watermarks to your CAD drawings!

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your .NET project:

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadObjects;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Load the CAD Drawing

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
using (CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(MyDir + "Drawing11.dwg")) {
```

## Step 2: Add Watermark as MTEXT

```csharp
// Add new MTEXT
CadMText watermark = new CadMText();
watermark.Text = "Watermark message";
watermark.InitialTextHeight = 40;
watermark.InsertionPoint = new Cad3DPoint(300, 40);
watermark.LayerName = "0";
cadImage.BlockEntities["*Model_Space"].AddEntity(watermark);
```

## Step 3: Or Add Watermark as Text

```csharp
// Alternatively, add a simpler entity like Text
CadText text = new CadText();
text.DefaultValue = "Watermark text";
text.TextHeight = 40;
text.FirstAlignment = new Cad3DPoint(300, 40);
text.LayerName = "0";
cadImage.BlockEntities["*Model_Space"].AddEntity(text);
```

## Step 4: Export to PDF

```csharp
// Export the CAD drawing with watermark to PDF
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 1600;
rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 1600;
rasterizationOptions.Layouts = new[] { "Model" };
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
cadImage.Save(MyDir + "AddWatermark_out.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

Repeat these steps for different drawings, and you'll have professional-looking watermarked CAD files in no time!
