# Opening and Accessing DWFX Files in C# - Aspose.CAD Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on opening and accessing DWFX files in C# using the powerful Aspose.CAD for .NET library. If you're a developer looking to integrate CAD functionality into your C# application, you're in the right place. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process, breaking it down into simple steps to make it accessible for developers of all skill levels.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.CAD for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.CAD library for .NET installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

2. Document Directory: Have a directory set up to store your DWFX files. Make note of the source and output directories in your C# code.

## Import Namespaces

In your C# project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
using System;
```

These namespaces provide the essential classes and functionality for working with CAD files in your application.

## Step 1: Set Up Source and Output Directories

```csharp
string SourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
string OutputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path to your source and output directories.

## Step 2: Load DWFX File

```csharp
using (Image cadDrawing = Image.Load(SourceDir + "Tyrannosaurus.dwfx"))
```

Load the DWFX file using the `Image.Load` method. Replace "Tyrannosaurus.dwfx" with the actual name of your DWFX file.

## Step 3: Configure Rasterization Options

```csharp
var rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = cadDrawing.Size.Width;
rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = cadDrawing.Size.Height;
```

Configure rasterization options based on the size of the loaded CAD drawing.

## Step 4: Save as PDF

```csharp
PdfOptions CADf = new PdfOptions();
CADf.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
cadDrawing.Save(OutputDir + "OpenDwfxFile_out.pdf", CADf);
```

Save the loaded DWFX file as a PDF, applying the configured rasterization options.

## Step 5: Display Success Message

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("OpenDwfxFile executed successfully");
```

Print a success message to the console to confirm the successful execution of the code.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to open and access DWFX files in C# using Aspose.CAD for .NET. This guide covered the essential steps, from setting up directories to loading, configuring, and saving the CAD file.
