# Export CAD Layouts to Raster Image Formats in Aspose.CAD for .NET

## Introduction

Are you looking to efficiently convert CAD layouts to raster image formats using Aspose.CAD for .NET? This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process, providing detailed instructions and code snippets to make the task seamless. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer to Aspose.CAD, this tutorial caters to all levels of expertise.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.CAD library installed. If not, you can download it from the [Aspose.CAD website](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

- CAD Drawing File: Prepare a CAD drawing file (e.g., conic_pyramid.dxf) that you want to convert to raster image formats.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, import the necessary namespaces to leverage Aspose.CAD functionalities. Include the following namespaces at the beginning of your code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
```

## Step 1: Load CAD Drawing

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";

// Load a CAD drawing in an instance of Image
using (var image = Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Your code for loading the CAD drawing goes here
}
```

## Step 2: Create CadRasterizationOptions

```csharp
// Create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions
var rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 500;
rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 500;
```

## Step 3: Specify Layers

```csharp
// Add the layer name to the CadRasterizationOptions's layer list
rasterizationOptions.Layers = new string[] { "LayerA" };
```

## Step 4: Create JpegOptions

```csharp
// Create an instance of JpegOptions (or any ImageOptions for raster formats)
var options = new JpegOptions();
options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
```

## Step 5: Export to Jpeg Format

```csharp
// Export each layer to Jpeg format
MyDir = MyDir + "CADLayersToRasterImageFormats_out.jpg";
image.Save(MyDir, options);
```

## Additional Step: Convert All Layers

If you want to convert all layers, use the following method:

```csharp
ConvertAllLayersToRasterImageFormats();
```

This method iterates over all layers in the CAD drawing, exporting each layer to a separate Jpeg file.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to export CAD layouts to raster image formats using Aspose.CAD for .NET. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide for developers seeking efficient and reliable solutions for CAD conversion.
