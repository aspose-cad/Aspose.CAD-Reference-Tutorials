# Exporting IFC Files to PNG - Aspose.CAD Tutorial

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of computer-aided design (CAD), efficient file conversion is crucial. Aspose.CAD for .NET emerges as a powerful tool, offering seamless capabilities for exporting IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) files to PNG format. This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through the process, ensuring a smooth experience with Aspose.CAD.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. Aspose.CAD Installation

Ensure that you have Aspose.CAD for .NET installed. You can download it from the release page [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

### 2. Document Directory

Create a designated directory for your documents. In the provided example, the variable `MyDir` represents the document directory.

## Import Namespaces

Now that you have the prerequisites set up, let's import the necessary namespaces in your .NET application to use Aspose.CAD functionalities.

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Ifc;
```

## Step 1: Load IFC File

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "example.ifc";
using (IfcImage cadImage = (IfcImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
```

In this step, we initialize the Aspose.CAD `IfcImage` object and load the IFC file into it.

## Step 2: Set Rasterization Options

```csharp
    CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
   
    rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 100;
    rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 100;
```

Define rasterization options to configure the page width and height for the PNG output.

## Step 3: Set PNG Options

```csharp
    PngOptions pngOptions = new PngOptions();
    pngOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
```

Create PNG options and associate the previously defined rasterization options.

## Step 4: Specify Output Path

```csharp
    // Set output path as well
    string outPath = sourceFilePath + ".png";
    cadImage.Save(outPath, pngOptions);
}
```

Define the output path for the PNG file, ensuring it has the same name as the source file with the ".png" extension. Finally, save the converted image.

## Conclusion

With these straightforward steps, you've successfully exported an IFC file to PNG using Aspose.CAD for .NET. This versatile tool simplifies the CAD conversion process, making it accessible for developers and engineers.
