## Introduction

In the dynamic world of computer-aided design (CAD), the need to convert IGES files to PDF format is a common requirement. Aspose.CAD for .NET provides a powerful solution for this task, offering flexibility and precision in handling CAD files. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of exporting IGES files to PDF using Aspose.CAD for .NET. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.CAD for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.CAD for .NET library integrated into your project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

2. Development Environment: Set up a .NET development environment, such as Visual Studio, with the necessary configurations.

Now that you have the prerequisites sorted, let's move on to importing the required namespaces.

## Import Namespaces

In your code, include the following namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadConsts;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadObjects;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using static Aspose.CAD.Examples.CSharp.DWG_Drawings.SupportMLeaderEntityForDWGFormat;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
```

These namespaces provide essential classes for working with CAD images and rasterization options.

## Step 1: Set up Your Project

Before diving into the code, create a new project or open an existing one in your preferred .NET development environment.

## Step 2: Add Aspose.CAD Reference

Reference the Aspose.CAD library in your project. You can do this by adding the downloaded Aspose.CAD DLL file.

## Step 3: Initialize the Path

Set the path to your document directory where the IGES file is located:

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "figa2.igs";
```

## Step 4: Load the CAD Image

Use the Aspose.CAD `Image.Load` method to load the IGES file:

```csharp
using (Image cadImage = Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```

## Step 5: Configure Rasterization Options

Define rasterization options to customize the PDF output:

```csharp
CadRasterizationOptions options = new CadRasterizationOptions
{
    PageHeight = 1000,
    PageWidth = 1000,
};

PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = options;
```

## Step 6: Save as PDF

Save the CAD image as a PDF file with the specified options:

```csharp
cadImage.Save(MyDir + "figa2.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

With these six straightforward steps, you've successfully exported an IGES file to PDF using Aspose.CAD for .NET.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored a seamless way to convert IGES files to PDF using Aspose.CAD for .NET. The step-by-step guide ensures a smooth and efficient process, empowering you to handle CAD files with precision.
