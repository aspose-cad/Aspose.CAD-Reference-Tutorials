# Editing Hyperlinks in CAD Files - Aspose.CAD Tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step tutorial on editing hyperlinks in CAD files using Aspose.CAD for .NET. Aspose.CAD is a powerful library that enables developers to work with CAD files seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will focus on the specific task of editing hyperlinks within CAD files, demonstrating how to modify and manage links efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of C# and .NET development.
- Aspose.CAD for .NET installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
- A sample CAD file for practice. You can use the provided "AutoCad_Sample.dwg" file.

## Import Namespaces

In your C# project, make sure to include the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.CAD:

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadObjects;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Load the CAD File

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string dwgPathToFile = MyDir + "AutoCad_Sample.dwg";

using (CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(dwgPathToFile))
{
    // Your code for editing hyperlinks will go here.
}
```

## Step 2: Iterate Through Entities

```csharp
foreach (CadBaseEntity entity in cadImage.Entities)
{
    // Your code for handling each entity will go here.
}
```

## Step 3: Edit Insert Objects

```csharp
if (entity is CadInsertObject)
{
    CadBlockEntity block = cadImage.BlockEntities[((CadInsertObject)entity).Name];
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(block.XRefPathName.Value))
    {
        block.XRefPathName.Value = "new file reference.dwg";
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Modify Hyperlinks

```csharp
if (entity.Hyperlink == "https://products.aspose.com")
{
    entity.Hyperlink = "https://www.aspose.com";
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to edit hyperlinks in CAD files using Aspose.CAD for .NET. This tutorial covered the essential steps, from loading the CAD file to modifying both insert objects and hyperlinks. Aspose.CAD provides a robust solution for managing CAD files programmatically.
