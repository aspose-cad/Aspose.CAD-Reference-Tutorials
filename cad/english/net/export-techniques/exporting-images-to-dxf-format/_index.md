# Exporting Images to DXF Format - Aspose.CAD Guide

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of software development, efficiency and precision are paramount. Aspose.CAD for .NET emerges as a powerful tool, providing developers with the capability to manipulate CAD drawings seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of exporting images to DXF format using Aspose.CAD in the .NET environment. Follow this step-by-step guide to unlock the potential of this tool and enhance your CAD-related workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.CAD library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

- Document Directory: Have a designated directory for your CAD documents. Replace "Your Document Directory" in the provided code with the actual path.

Now, let's dive into the process.

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces to leverage the functionalities of Aspose.CAD:

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadConsts;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadObjects;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadTables;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Set New Font for Each Document

```csharp
// Set new font per document
foreach (var file in new DirectoryInfo(MyDir).EnumerateFiles("conic.dxf"))
{
    using (var cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(file.FullName))
    {
        foreach (CadStyleTableObject style in cadImage.Styles)
        {
            // Set font name
            style.PrimaryFontName = "Broadway";
        }
        cadImage.Save(file.FullName + "_font.dxf");
    }
}
```

In this step, we customize the font for each CAD document, adding a touch of uniqueness to your visual representations.

## Step 2: Hide All "Straight" Lines

```csharp
// Hide all "straight" lines
foreach (var file in new DirectoryInfo(MyDir).EnumerateFiles("conic.dxf"))
{
    using (var cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(file.FullName))
    {
        foreach (var entity in cadImage.Entities)
        {
            // Make lines invisible
            if (entity.TypeName == CadEntityTypeName.LINE)
            {
                entity.Visible = 0;
            }
        }
        cadImage.Save(file.FullName + "_lines.dxf");
    }
}
```

This step focuses on enhancing the visual appeal by hiding straight lines in your CAD drawings.

## Step 3: Manipulations with Text

```csharp
// Manipulations with text
foreach (var file in new DirectoryInfo(MyDir).EnumerateFiles("conic.dxf"))
{
    using (var cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(file.FullName))
    {
        foreach (var entity in cadImage.Entities)
        {
            if (entity.TypeName == CadEntityTypeName.TEXT)
            {
                // Modify text content
                ((CadText)entity).DefaultValue = "New text here!!! :)";
                break;
            }
        }
        cadImage.Save(file.FullName + "_text.dxf");
    }
}
```

In this final step, we showcase how to dynamically manipulate text within your CAD drawings, providing a more interactive and personalized touch.
