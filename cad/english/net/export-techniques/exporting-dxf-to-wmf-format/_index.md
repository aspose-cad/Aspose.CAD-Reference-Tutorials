# Exporting DXF to WMF Format - Aspose.CAD Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive tutorial on exporting DXF files to PDF format using Aspose.CAD for .NET! If you're a developer looking to seamlessly integrate this functionality into your .NET applications, you're in the right place. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process step by step, ensuring you grasp each concept thoroughly.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET Library: Ensure you have the Aspose.CAD library integrated into your .NET project. If not, you can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

- DXF File: Prepare a DXF file that you want to export to PDF. If you don't have one, you can use the provided "conic_pyramid.dxf" file in the tutorial.

Now, let's get started!

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your .NET project. This step ensures that you have access to all the classes and methods required for DXF to PDF conversion.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the DXF File

Start by loading the DXF file into the Aspose.CAD image object.

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";

using (Image image = Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Your code for subsequent steps will go here
}
```

## Step 2: Set Rasterization Options

Create an instance of `CadRasterizationOptions` and set various properties like background color, page width, and page height.

```csharp
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.BackgroundColor = Color.White;
rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 1600;
rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 1600;
```

## Step 3: Create PDF Options

Create an instance of `PdfOptions` and set its `VectorRasterizationOptions` property using the previously defined rasterization options.

```csharp
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
```

## Step 4: Specify Output Path

Define the output path for the PDF file.

```csharp
MyDir = MyDir + "conic_pyramid_out.pdf";
```

## Step 5: Export DXF to PDF

Finally, export the DXF file to PDF using the configured options.

```csharp
image.Save(MyDir, pdfOptions);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully exported a DXF file to PDF using Aspose.CAD for .NET. This guide has walked you through the essential steps, making the process seamless and efficient.
