# Supporting OBJ Format in Aspose.CAD - Tutorial

## Introduction

If you're delving into the world of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) in .NET development, you might encounter the need to work with OBJ files. Aspose.CAD for .NET is a robust solution that empowers developers to seamlessly support OBJ format within their applications. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of incorporating Aspose.CAD into your project to work with OBJ files effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.CAD library installed in your .NET project. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

- Document Directory: Set up a directory where your CAD documents, specifically OBJ files, are stored. In this tutorial, we'll use the placeholder directory "Your Document Directory."

## Import Namespaces

To kick things off, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your .NET project. These namespaces provide access to the functionalities required for handling CAD files.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```


## Step 1: Load OBJ File

Load the OBJ file into the Aspose.CAD image object. Replace "example-580-W.obj" with the name of your OBJ file.

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
using (Aspose.CAD.Image CADDoc = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load(MyDir + "example-580-W.obj"))
{
    // Your code for further processing goes here
}
```

## Step 2: Configure Rasterization Options

Set up rasterization options to define the dimensions of the output PDF based on the dimensions of the loaded CAD document.

```csharp
Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions =
    new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions();

rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = CADDoc.Size.Width;
rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = CADDoc.Size.Height;
```

## Step 3: Create PDF Options

Create PDF options and associate them with the rasterization options.

```csharp
Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.PdfOptions CADf = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.PdfOptions();
CADf.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
```

## Step 4: Save as PDF

Save the CAD document as a custom PDF file, incorporating the configured options.

```csharp
CADDoc.Save(MyDir + "example-580-W_custom.pdf", CADf);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully integrated Aspose.CAD for .NET to support OBJ format in your application. This tutorial has equipped you with the necessary steps to handle OBJ files seamlessly within your CAD projects.
