# Exporting DWG to DXF Format in C# - Aspose.CAD Tutorial

## Introduction

If you're a .NET developer seeking a powerful solution for manipulating CAD files, Aspose.CAD is your go-to tool. In this step-by-step tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of exporting a DWG file to the DXF format using C# with Aspose.CAD.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.CAD Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD library from [this link](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

2. Development Environment: Set up a C# development environment, such as Visual Studio.

3. Sample DWG File: Prepare a sample DWG file that you want to export. For this tutorial, we'll use a file named "Line.dwg" in the directory "Your Document Directory."

## Import Namespaces

In your C# project, include the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.CAD:

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Load the DWG File

Begin by loading the DWG file into your C# application. Here's a code snippet to achieve this:

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string inputFile = MyDir + "Line.dwg";
using (var cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(inputFile))
{
    // Your code for further steps will go here
}
```

## Step 2: Save as DXF

Once the DWG file is loaded, the next step is to save it as a DXF file. Add the following code within the previous using block:

```csharp
string outFile = MyDir + "Line_19.2.dxf";
cadImage.Save(outFile);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully exported a DWG file to DXF format using Aspose.CAD in C#. This simple yet powerful process opens up a world of possibilities for CAD file manipulation in your applications.
