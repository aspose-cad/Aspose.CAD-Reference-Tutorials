# Exporting CAD Drawings to SVG Format - Aspose.CAD Guide

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of CAD (Computer-Aided Design), the ability to export drawings into various formats is a crucial skill. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is one such format that has gained popularity due to its scalability and versatility. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to export CAD drawings to SVG using the powerful Aspose.CAD for .NET library.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD for .NET library. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

```

## Step 1: Set the Document Directory

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Load the CAD Drawing

```csharp
using (Image image = Image.Load(MyDir + "sample.dwg"))
{
```

## Step 3: Configure SVG Export Options

```csharp
    var options = new SvgOptions();
    options.ColorType = SvgColorMode.Grayscale;
