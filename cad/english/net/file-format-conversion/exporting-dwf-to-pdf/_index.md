# Exporting DWF to PDF - Aspose.CAD Guide

## Introduction

In the world of .NET development, Aspose.CAD stands out as a powerful library for handling Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files. In this tutorial, we'll focus on a specific task: exporting DWF (Design Web Format) files to PDF using Aspose.CAD for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, follow along to seamlessly integrate this functionality into your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET: Ensure that you have Aspose.CAD for .NET installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

- Development Environment: Set up a working .NET development environment, including Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE.

## Import Namespaces

Start by importing the necessary namespaces into your project. This step is crucial for accessing the functionalities provided by Aspose.CAD.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the DWF File

Begin by loading the DWF file that you want to export to PDF. Adjust the file path accordingly.

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string fileName = MyDir + "18-12-11 9644 - site.dwf";

using (Image image = Image.Load(fileName))
{
    // Your code here...
}
```

## Step 2: Configure Rasterization Options

Set up the rasterization options for DWF to ensure the desired output. In this example, we define the page height and width.

```csharp
CadRasterizationOptions dwfRasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
dwfRasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 500;
dwfRasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 500;
```

## Step 3: Define PDF Options

Create PDF options and associate them with the previously configured rasterization options.

```csharp
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = dwfRasterizationOptions;
```

## Step 4: Export to PDF

Execute the export process, specifying the output path for the resulting PDF file.

```csharp
string outPath = MyDir + "18-12-11 9644 - site.pdf";
image.Save(outPath, pdfOptions);
```

## Step 5: Verify the Export

Ensure the successful export of 3D images to PDF. Display a confirmation message with the saved file path.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\n3D images exported successfully to PDF.\nFile saved at " + MyDir);
```

Now you have successfully implemented the DWF to PDF export functionality in your .NET application using Aspose.CAD.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the process of exporting DWF files to PDF using Aspose.CAD for .NET. By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your projects, enhancing your CAD file handling capabilities.
