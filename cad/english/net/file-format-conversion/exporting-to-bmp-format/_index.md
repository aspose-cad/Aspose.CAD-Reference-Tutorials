# Exporting to BMP Format - Aspose.CAD Tutorial

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of software development, Aspose.CAD for .NET stands out as a powerful tool for handling Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files. If you're looking to export CAD images to the widely used BMP format, this tutorial is your go-to guide. In this step-by-step walkthrough, we will explore the process of exporting 3D images to BMP using Aspose.CAD for .NET. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.CAD library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
- Development Environment: Set up a .NET development environment.
- CAD File: Have a CAD file ready for export. For this example, we'll use "18-12-11 9644 - site.dwf."

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, make sure to import the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the CAD Image

Begin by loading the CAD image into your project. Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual directory path.

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string inputFile = MyDir + "18-12-11 9644 - site.dwf";

using (Image image = Image.Load(inputFile))
{
    // Your code for loading the image goes here
}
```

## Step 2: Configure BMP Export Options

Set up the BMP export options, including vector rasterization options for CAD files.

```csharp
BmpOptions bmpOptions = new BmpOptions();
var dwfRasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
bmpOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = dwfRasterizationOptions;

dwfRasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 500;
dwfRasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 500;
```

## Step 3: Export to BMP

Execute the export process, specifying the output path for the BMP file.

```csharp
string outPath = MyDir + "18-12-11 9644 - site.bmp";
image.Save(outPath, bmpOptions);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully exported a 3D image to BMP using Aspose.CAD for .NET. This tutorial provides a glimpse into the versatility of Aspose.CAD, making complex tasks feel like a breeze.
