## Introduction

In the realm of CAD (Computer-Aided Design), precision and tracking are paramount. Aspose.CAD for .NET provides a robust solution for enabling tracking in CAD files. This tutorial will guide you through the process, ensuring you harness the full potential of this feature.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.CAD for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.CAD library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
- Document File: Have a CAD document ready for tracking. For this tutorial, we'll use "conic_pyramid.dxf."
- Document Directory: Set up a directory for your documents. Replace "Your Document Directory" in the code with the actual path.
Now that you have everything set up, let's delve into the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Load the CAD Image

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
using (Image image = Image.Load(MyDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf"))
{
    // Code for the next steps will be added here
}
```

## Step 2: Set Up PDF Export Options

```csharp
using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(MyDir + "output_conic_pyramid.pdf", FileMode.Create))
{
    PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
    CadRasterizationOptions cadRasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
    pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = cadRasterizationOptions;
    cadRasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 800;
    cadRasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 600;
```

## Step 3: Implement Tracking

```csharp
    int idxError = 1;
    cadRasterizationOptions.RenderResult += new CadRasterizationOptions.CadRenderHandler(
        delegate (CadRenderResult result)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Tracking results of exporting");
            if (result.IsRenderComplete)
                return;
            Console.WriteLine("Have some problems:");
            foreach (RenderResult rr in result.Failures)
                Console.WriteLine(string.Format("{0}. {1}, {2}", idxError++, rr.RenderCode.ToString(), rr.Message));
        });
```

## Step 4: Save to PDF Format

```csharp
    Console.WriteLine("Exporting to pdf format");
    image.Save(stream, pdfOptions);
}
```

Congratulations! You've successfully enabled tracking in CAD files using Aspose.CAD for .NET. Feel free to explore the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/) for more details.
