# Adding Attributes to CAD Drawings - Aspose.CAD Tutorial

## Introduction

In the realm of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), enriching drawings with attributes is a crucial step for detailed documentation and effective communication. Aspose.CAD for .NET provides a robust solution to seamlessly integrate attributes into CAD drawings. This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding attributes to CAD drawings using Aspose.CAD, allowing you to enhance the information embedded in your designs.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.CAD library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

- Development Environment: Set up a working development environment with Visual Studio or any other preferred .NET IDE.

- Sample CAD Drawing: For this tutorial, we'll be using the "conic_pyramid.dxf" file. Ensure you have this file in your designated document directory.

## Import Namespaces

To start, import the necessary namespaces in your .NET application. These namespaces are essential for working with CAD drawings using Aspose.CAD.

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadConsts;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadObjects;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Load the CAD Drawing

Begin by loading the CAD drawing into your application using the following code snippet:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";

using (CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Your code for further steps will go here.
}
```

## Step 2: Identify MTEXT Entities

In this step, we identify MTEXT entities within the CAD drawing and add them to a list.

```csharp
List<CadBaseEntity> mtextList = new List<CadBaseEntity>();

foreach (var entity in cadImage.Entities)
{
    if (entity.TypeName == CadEntityTypeName.MTEXT)
    {
        mtextList.Add(entity);
    }
}

// Assert the count for verification.
Assert.AreEqual(6, mtextList.Count);
```

## Step 3: Identify INSERT Entities and ATTRIB Child Objects

Now, we focus on INSERT entities and their child objects of type ATTRIB.

```csharp
List<CadBaseEntity> attribList = new List<CadBaseEntity>();

foreach (var entity in cadImage.Entities)
{
    if (entity.TypeName == CadEntityTypeName.INSERT)
    {
        foreach (var childObject in entity.ChildObjects)
        {
            if (childObject.TypeName == CadEntityTypeName.ATTRIB)
            {
                attribList.Add(childObject);
            }
        }
    }
}

// Assert the counts for verification.
Assert.AreEqual(34, attribList.Count);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully added attributes to CAD drawings using Aspose.CAD for .NET. This tutorial has equipped you with the fundamental steps to enhance the information within your designs.
