# Aspose.CAD for .NET에서 사용자 정의 펜 옵션으로 CAD 내보내기 향상

## Introduction

If you need to **create PDF from CAD** files quickly and with full visual control, Aspose.CAD for .NET gives you exactly that. By leveraging the library’s pen‑support feature you can define start and end caps, line joins, and other drawing attributes, producing PDFs that look exactly how you want them. This tutorial walks you through the entire process—from loading a DXF file to exporting a polished PDF—while also showing how the same settings can be reused when you **export CAD to PNG** or **rasterize CAD image** data for other formats.

## Quick Answers
- **What does “create PDF from CAD” mean?** It converts vector‑based CAD drawings (e.g., DXF) into a PDF document while preserving geometry and styling.  
- **Which formats support pen options?** PDF, PNG, BMP, GIF, JPEG2000, JPEG, PSD, TIFF, and WMF.  
- **Do I need a license for development?** A free trial works for testing; a commercial license is required for production.  
- **Can I change line caps for other formats?** Yes—pen options apply to any rasterization target supported by Aspose.CAD.  
- **What .NET versions are supported?** .NET Framework 4.5+, .NET Core 3.1+, .NET 5/6/7.

## What is pen support in CAD export?

Pen support lets you customize how lines are drawn when a CAD drawing is rasterized or vector‑rasterized. You can set properties such as `StartCap`, `EndCap`, `LineJoin`, and `DashStyle`. These settings affect the final appearance of the exported image or PDF, giving you fine‑grained control over visual quality.

## Why use custom pen options when you **create PDF from CAD**?

- **Consistent branding** – match corporate line styles across all documents.  
- **Improved readability** – thicker caps and joins make technical drawings clearer on screen and print.  
- **Cross‑format flexibility** – the same pen configuration works for PNG, BMP, and other raster formats, saving you time.

## Prerequisites

- Aspose.CAD for .NET installed (download from the [release page](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/)).  
- Basic knowledge of DXF (Drawing Exchange Format).  
- Familiarity with C# programming.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, make sure you import the necessary namespaces in your C# project:

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

Define the folder that contains the source CAD file:

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Load the CAD Image

Load the CAD drawing (for example, a DXF file) into an `Aspose.CAD.Image` object:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath);
```

## Step 3: Configure Rasterization Options

Create rasterization and PDF options objects. These objects let you control how the CAD data is turned into a raster image or PDF page:

```csharp
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
```

## Step 4: Customize Pen Options

Here’s where you **customize the pen** that draws the lines. You can set the start and end caps to `Flat`, `Round`, `Square`, etc. This is the core of “how to export CAD” with the visual style you need:

```csharp
rasterizationOptions.PenOptions = new PenOptions
{
   StartCap = LineCap.Flat,
   EndCap = LineCap.Flat
};
```

*Pro tip:* Experiment with `LineCap.Round` for smoother line ends when you **export CAD to PNG**.

## Step 5: Apply Vector Rasterization Options

Attach the rasterization settings to the PDF options so the export process knows which pen configuration to use:

```csharp
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
```

## Step 6: Save the Exported PDF

Finally, generate the PDF file. This step **creates PDF from CAD** with the custom pen settings applied:

```csharp
cadImage.Save(MyDir + "9LHATT-A56_generated.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

You can replace the `PdfOptions` with `PngOptions`, `BmpOptions`, etc., to **export CAD to PNG** or other raster formats while keeping the same pen configuration.

## Common Use Cases

- **Technical documentation** – embed precise line styles in engineering PDFs.  
- **Automated report generation** – batch‑process many DXF files into PDFs with a single pen profile.  
- **Web services** – expose an API that converts uploaded DXF files to PDFs on‑the‑fly, ensuring consistent styling.

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Reason | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Exported lines look thicker than expected | DPI is higher than intended | Set `rasterizationOptions.PageWidth` / `PageHeight` or adjust `Resolution`. |
| Pen options are ignored for PNG output | Using `ImageOptions` instead of `VectorRasterizationOptions` | Ensure you assign `rasterizationOptions.PenOptions` before saving. |
| PDF file is empty | Source DXF path is incorrect or file is corrupted | Verify `sourceFilePath` and confirm the DXF loads without exceptions. |

## FAQ's

### Q1: Can I use these pen options for other image formats besides PDF?

A1: Yes, the pen options can be applied to various image formats such as PNG, BMP, GIF, JPEG, and more.

### Q2: Where can I find additional documentation for Aspose.CAD for .NET?

A2: Refer to the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/) for comprehensive information and examples.

### Q3: Is there a free trial available for Aspose.CAD for .NET?

A3: Yes, you can access a free trial [here](https://releases.aspose.com/).

### Q4: How can I get temporary licenses for Aspose.CAD for .NET?

A4: Visit the [temporary license page](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for temporary licensing options.

### Q5: Where can I seek community support for Aspose.CAD for .NET?

A5: Engage with the community on the [Aspose.CAD forum](https://forum.aspose.com/c/cad/19).

## Additional Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I **convert DXF to PDF** programmatically?**  
A: Load the DXF with `Image.Load`, configure `CadRasterizationOptions` and `PdfOptions`, then call `Save` as shown in the steps above.

**Q: Can I rasterize a CAD image without creating a PDF?**  
A: Yes—use `PngOptions`, `BmpOptions`, or any other raster format class and assign the same `rasterizationOptions` to achieve high‑quality rasterization.

**Q: Is it possible to change the line width when creating a PDF from CAD?**  
A: Adjust `rasterizationOptions.CustomLineWidth` or modify the `PenOptions.Width` property before saving.

**Q: Does the library support 3D DXF files?**  
A: Aspose.CAD focuses on 2D vector data; 3D entities are ignored during rasterization.

**Q: What version of Aspose.CAD is required for these features?**  
A: Pen support has been available since version 20.9; any newer version will work.
