## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on saving DXF files using Aspose.CAD for .NET! If you're a developer looking to manipulate CAD files seamlessly, you're in the right place. Aspose.CAD for .NET provides powerful tools to work with CAD formats, and in this tutorial, we'll focus on saving DXF files. So, let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, ensure you have the following:

1. Aspose.CAD for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.CAD library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

2. Your Document Directory: Set up a directory for your documents where you'll save and retrieve DXF files.

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
```

Now, let's break down the example you provided into multiple steps for a clear, concise guide.

## Step 1: Load the DXF File

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";

using (CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Any necessary entities updates can be done here.
}
```

In this step, we load the DXF file "conic_pyramid.dxf" using Aspose.CAD's `Image.Load` method.

## Step 2: Save the DXF File

```csharp
cadImage.Save(MyDir + "conic.dxf");
```

Once the DXF file is loaded, use the `Save` method to save it as "conic.dxf" in the specified directory.
