Welcome to the world of Aspose.CAD for .NET â€“ a powerful tool that empowers developers to manipulate CAD files seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of applying a license using FileStream, ensuring you harness the full potential of Aspose.CAD in your .NET projects.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Aspose.CAD for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.CAD for .NET library installed in your development environment. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
2. License File: Acquire a valid license file for Aspose.CAD. You can obtain one by purchasing it [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy). If you want to try the library first, grab a free trial [here](https://releases.aspose.com/).
## Import Namespaces
Now that you have the prerequisites ready, let's start by importing the necessary namespaces into your .NET project. This step is crucial to access the functionality provided by Aspose.CAD.

## Applying License Using FileStream in Aspose.CAD for .NET
## Step 1: Set the License File Path
Begin by setting the path of your Aspose.CAD license file. In this example, we assume it's located in the "c:\temp\" directory.
```csharp
string dataDir = @"c:\temp\";
```
## Step 2: Load the License File into a FileStream
Next, create a `FileStream` to load the license file. The following code demonstrates how to do this:
```csharp
FileStream LicStream = new FileStream(dataDir + "Aspose.CAD.lic", FileMode.Open);
```
## Step 3: Apply the License
Now, create an instance of the `License` class and set the license using the `SetLicense` method.
```csharp
License license = new License();
license.SetLicense(LicStream);
```
Congratulations! You've successfully applied the license using FileStream in Aspose.CAD for .NET.
