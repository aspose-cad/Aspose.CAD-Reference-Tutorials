## Introduction

Unlocking the full potential of Aspose.CAD for .NET requires understanding the intricacies of metered licensing. This powerful feature allows developers to efficiently manage resource consumption while harnessing the capabilities of Aspose.CAD. In this step-by-step guide, we will delve into the process of implementing metered licensing, breaking down each crucial step to ensure seamless integration into your .NET projects.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Aspose.CAD Installation: Ensure that you have Aspose.CAD for .NET installed in your development environment. If not, download it from the [Aspose.CAD website](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
2. Access to Public and Private Keys: Obtain the public and private keys required for metered licensing. If you don't have them yet, you can acquire them through the [Aspose.CAD purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).
3. Basic Knowledge of .NET: Familiarize yourself with the basics of .NET development, as this guide assumes a foundational understanding of the framework.

## Import Namespaces

To begin the metered licensing process in Aspose.CAD for .NET, make sure to import the necessary namespaces into your project. Add the following code at the beginning of your file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Now, let's break down each step in the tutorial:

## Step 1: Set Metered Key

```csharp
//ExStart:MeteredLicensing
// Access the setMeteredKey property and pass public and private keys as parameters
Aspose.CAD.Metered.SetMeteredKey("PublicKey", "PrivateKey");
```

In this initial step, set the metered key by invoking the `SetMeteredKey` method and providing your public and private keys.

## Step 2: Get Consumption Quantity Before API Call

```csharp
// Get metered data amount before calling API
decimal amountbefore = Aspose.CAD.Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity();
// Display information
Console.WriteLine("Amount Consumed Before: " + amountbefore.ToString());
```

Retrieve the amount of metered data consumed before making any API calls to gauge your resource usage.

## Step 3: Process Data

```csharp
// Do processing
//Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadImage image = (Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadImage)Aspose.CAD.Image.load("BlockRefDgn.dwg");
```

Perform your desired processing tasks with Aspose.CAD, such as loading CAD images or manipulating existing ones.

## Step 4: Get Consumption Quantity After API Call

```csharp
// Get metered data amount after calling API
decimal amountafter = Aspose.CAD.Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity();
// Display information
Console.WriteLine("Amount Consumed After: " + amountafter.ToString());
//ExEnd:MeteredLicensing 
```

After executing your API calls, retrieve the updated metered data amount to track resource consumption.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, mastering metered licensing in Aspose.CAD for .NET empowers developers to optimize resource usage effectively. By following this guide, you've gained insights into the seamless integration of metered licensing, ensuring efficient utilization of the Aspose.CAD capabilities.
