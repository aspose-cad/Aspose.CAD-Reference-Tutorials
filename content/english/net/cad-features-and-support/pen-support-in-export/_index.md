## Introduction

Aspose.CAD for .NET provides a powerful set of tools for working with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files, enabling developers to manipulate and export CAD images seamlessly. One notable feature is the pen support during export, allowing users to customize start and end cap settings for pens when exporting CAD images to various formats like PDF, PNG, BMP, GIF, JPEG2000, JPEG, PSD, TIFF, and WMF.

In this tutorial, we'll delve into the specifics of pen support in export using Aspose.CAD for .NET. We'll break down each step, providing clear explanations and examples to guide you through the process.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download it from the [release page](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

- A basic understanding of CAD file formats, particularly DXF (Drawing Exchange Format).

- A working knowledge of C# programming language.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, make sure you import the necessary namespaces in your C# project:

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

Define the directory where your CAD document is located:

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Load the CAD Image

Load the CAD image using Aspose.CAD:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath);
```

## Step 3: Configure Rasterization Options

Create rasterization and PDF options to customize the export process:

```csharp
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
```

## Step 4: Customize Pen Options

Set the start and end cap options for pens:

```csharp
rasterizationOptions.PenOptions = new PenOptions
{
   StartCap = LineCap.Flat,
   EndCap = LineCap.Flat
};
```

## Step 5: Apply Vector Rasterization Options

Apply the rasterization options to the PDF options:

```csharp
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
```

## Step 6: Save the Exported PDF

Save the CAD image with customized pen options as a PDF file:

```csharp
cadImage.Save(MyDir + "9LHATT-A56_generated.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored the pen support in export feature of Aspose.CAD for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can easily customize start and end cap settings for pens, enhancing the flexibility of your CAD image exports.

Feel free to experiment with different pen options to achieve the desired visual effects in your exported images.
