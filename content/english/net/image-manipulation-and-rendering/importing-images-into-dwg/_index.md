## Introduction

In the realm of computer-aided design (CAD), incorporating images into DWG files is a common and crucial task. Aspose.CAD for .NET provides a powerful set of tools to streamline this process, making it accessible for C# developers. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to import images into DWG files step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the guide, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of C# programming.
- Aspose.CAD for .NET installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
- A development environment set up.

## Import Namespaces

Make sure to include the necessary namespaces in your C# project:

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad.CadObjects;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Load the DWG File

```csharp
string dwgPathToFile = MyDir + "Drawing11.dwg";
CadImage cadImage1 = (CadImage)Image.Load(dwgPathToFile);
```

## Step 3: Define the Image Properties

```csharp
CadRasterImageDef cadRasterImageDef = new CadRasterImageDef("road-sign-custom.png", 640, 562);
cadRasterImageDef.ObjectHandle = "A3B4";
```

## Step 4: Set Insertion Point and Vectors

```csharp
Cad3DPoint insertionPoint = new Cad3DPoint(26.77, 22.35);
Cad3DPoint uVector = new Cad3DPoint(0.0061565450840500831, 0);
Cad3DPoint vVector = new Cad3DPoint(0, 0.0061565450840500822);
```

## Step 5: Create and Configure the Raster Image

```csharp
CadRasterImage cadRasterImage = new CadRasterImage(cadRasterImageDef, insertionPoint, uVector, vVector);
cadRasterImage.ImageDefReference = "A3B4";
cadRasterImage.DisplayFlags = 7;
cadRasterImage.ClippingState = 0;
cadRasterImage.ClipBoundaryVertexList.Add(new Cad2DPoint(-0.5, 0.5));
cadRasterImage.ClipBoundaryVertexList.Add(new Cad2DPoint(639.5, 561.5));
```

## Step 6: Add Image to DWG File

```csharp
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)cadImage1;
cadImage.BlockEntities["*Model_Space"].AddEntity(cadRasterImage);

List<CadBaseObject> list = new List<CadBaseObject>(cadImage.Objects);
list.Add(cadRasterImageDef);
cadImage.Objects = list.ToArray();
```

## Step 7: Save as PDF

```csharp
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
CadRasterizationOptions cadRasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = cadRasterizationOptions;
cadRasterizationOptions.DrawType = CadDrawTypeMode.UseObjectColor;

cadRasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 1600;
cadRasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 1600;
cadRasterizationOptions.Layouts = new string[] { "Model" };
cadImage1.Save(MyDir + "export2.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

## Conclusion

Integrating images into DWG files using C# and Aspose.CAD for .NET is a seamless process, empowering developers to enhance their CAD projects with visual elements effortlessly.
