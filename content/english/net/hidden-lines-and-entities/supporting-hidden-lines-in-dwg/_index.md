## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on supporting hidden lines in DWG files using Aspose.CAD for .NET. If you're looking to enhance your CAD projects by incorporating hidden lines in your DWG files, you're in the right place. In this guide, we'll break down the process into easy-to-follow steps, using Aspose.CAD to seamlessly achieve the desired results.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.CAD for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.CAD library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).
- Development Environment: Set up a working development environment with .NET capabilities.
- Sample DWG File: Have a DWG file ready for testing. You can use the provided "Bottom_plate.dwg" file.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, make sure to import the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.CAD. Include the following at the top of your code file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;;
```

## Step 1: Load the DWG File

Start by loading your DWG file using the Aspose.CAD library. Ensure you provide the correct path to your document directory.

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = MyDir + "Bottom_plate.dwg";
string outPath = MyDir + "Bottom_plate.pdf";

using (CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Code for the next steps will go here
}
```

## Step 2: Set Rasterization Options

Define rasterization options to customize the conversion process. This includes specifying page dimensions, layers to include, and layouts to consider.

```csharp
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = cadImage.Height;
rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = cadImage.Width;
rasterizationOptions.Layers = new string[] { "Print", "L1_RegMark", "L2_RegMark" };
```

## Step 3: Configure PDF Options

Set up options for the PDF output, including vector rasterization options.

```csharp
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
rasterizationOptions.Layouts = new string[] { "Model" };
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
```

## Step 4: Save the PDF File

Save the CAD image to a PDF file with the specified options.

```csharp
cadImage.Save(outPath, pdfOptions);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully supported hidden lines in your DWG file using Aspose.CAD for .NET. This tutorial provided a detailed, step-by-step guide to help you seamlessly integrate this functionality into your CAD projects.
