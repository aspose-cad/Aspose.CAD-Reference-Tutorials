## Introduction

Are you looking to extract OLE objects from DWG files with ease? Aspose.CAD for .NET is here to streamline the process for you. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through exporting OLE objects step by step, ensuring you make the most of this powerful .NET library. 

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for .NET Library: Make sure you have the library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.CAD for .NET download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

- Document Directory: Set up a directory where your DWG files are stored. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` in the provided code snippet with the actual path.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces to leverage Aspose.CAD functionalities. Use the following code snippet:

```csharp
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Cad;
using Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Set the Document Directory

```csharp
string MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path where your DWG files are located.

## Step 2: Specify DWG Files

```csharp
string[] files = new string[] { "D ZD junior D10m H2m.dwg", "ZD - Senior D6m H2m45.dwg" };
```

List the DWG files you want to process within the array.

## Step 3: Configure Export Options

```csharp
PngOptions pngOptions = new PngOptions { };
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
pngOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
rasterizationOptions.Layouts = new string[] { "Layout1" };
```

Customize the export options based on your requirements. In this example, we configure PNG export with a specified layout.

## Step 4: Iterate Through Files and Export

```csharp
foreach (string file in files)
{
    using (CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(MyDir + file))
    {
        cadImage.Save(MyDir + file + "_out.png", pngOptions);
    }
}
```

Iterate through the specified DWG files, load each one, and save the exported PNG file with the defined options.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully exported OLE objects from DWG files using Aspose.CAD for .NET. This powerful library simplifies complex tasks, providing efficiency and flexibility in CAD file manipulation.
