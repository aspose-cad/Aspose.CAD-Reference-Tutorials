## Introduction

In the realm of computer-aided design (CAD), understanding file formats is crucial for seamless collaboration and efficient workflows. Two common formats, DWT and DWG, often lead to confusion due to their similarities. This tutorial aims to demystify these formats using Aspose.CAD for .NET, a powerful library for CAD file manipulation.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.CAD for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD for .NET library from the [releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

2. Sample Files: Obtain sample DWT and DWG files for hands-on learning. You can find them on your desktop or use files from your CAD projects.

## Import Namespaces

To begin, let's import the necessary namespaces into your .NET project. These namespaces provide the essential classes and methods for working with CAD files using Aspose.CAD.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## 1. Determine DWT Format

To distinguish the DWT format using Aspose.CAD, follow these steps:

### 1.1 Load the DWT File

```csharp
// Load the DWT file
var formatTypeDwt = Image.GetFileFormat(GetFileFromDesktop("sample.dwt"));
```

### 1.2 Verify Format Type

```csharp
// Verify if the format is DWT
Assert.IsTrue(formatTypeDwt.ToString().ToLower().Contains("dwt"));
```

## 2. Determine DWG Format

Similarly, to identify the DWG format, use the following steps:

### 2.1 Load the DWG File

```csharp
// Load the DWG file
var formatTypeDwg = Image.GetFileFormat(GetFileFromDesktop("sample.dwg"));
```

### 2.2 Verify Format Type

```csharp
// Verify if the format is DWG
Assert.IsTrue(formatTypeDwg.ToString().ToLower().Contains("dwg"));
```

Repeat these steps for any other files you wish to analyze. Now, you can confidently distinguish between DWT and DWG formats using Aspose.CAD for .NET.

## Conclusion

Navigating through CAD file formats is made simpler with Aspose.CAD for .NET. By distinguishing between DWT and DWG formats, you enhance your CAD development experience, fostering smoother collaboration and increased productivity.
