## Introduction

Are you looking to unlock the full potential of AutoCAD drawings in your Java applications? Aspose.CAD for Java is your go-to solution, offering a seamless integration to manipulate and extract valuable information from DWG and DXF files. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of listing all layouts in an AutoCAD drawing using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Obtain the Aspose.CAD for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).
- AutoCAD Drawing: Have an AutoCAD drawing file (DWG or DXF) ready for testing. You can use the provided sample file, "conic_pyramid.dxf," for this tutorial.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages to kickstart your AutoCAD exploration:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadLayoutDictionary;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.CadLayout;
```

## Step 1: Load the AutoCAD Drawing

To begin, load the AutoCAD drawing file using Aspose.CAD for Java:

```java
// Load the AutoCAD drawing
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "DWGDrawings/";
String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";
Image image = Image.load(srcFile);
```

## Step 2: Extract Layout Information

Access the layout information from the loaded AutoCAD drawing:

```java
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)image;
CadLayoutDictionary layouts = cadImage.getLayouts();
```

## Step 3: Iterate Through Layouts

Iterate through each layout in the AutoCAD drawing and print the layout names:

```java
for (CadLayout layout : layouts.getValues()) {
    System.out.println("Layout " + layout.getLayoutName());
}
```

Repeat these steps, and you'll successfully list all layouts in your AutoCAD drawing using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Conclusion

Exploring AutoCAD drawings programmatically is now at your fingertips with Aspose.CAD for Java. This tutorial has equipped you with the knowledge to seamlessly integrate the library into your Java applications and extract valuable layout information. Enhance your CAD manipulation capabilities and stay ahead in your development journey!
