## Introduction

In the dynamic world of CAD (Computer-Aided Design), efficient conversion of DGN (Design) files to PDF (Portable Document Format) is a crucial requirement. Aspose.CAD for Java emerges as a powerful solution, offering seamless integration and robust capabilities. This step-by-step guide aims to walk you through the process of exporting DGN files to PDF using Aspose.CAD for Java, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Download and install the library from the [Aspose.CAD for Java Download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).
- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.

## Import Packages

Start by importing the necessary packages into your Java project:

## Step 1: Import Necessary Packages

In your Java project, import the required packages for Aspose.CAD for Java.
```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.DgnImage;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
import java.awt.Color;
```

## Step 2: Set File Paths

Define the paths for your input DGN file and the output PDF file.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ExportingDGN/";
String fileName = dataDir + "Nikon_D90_Camera.dgn";
String outFile  = dataDir + "Nikon_D90_Camera.pdf";
```

## Step 3: Load DGN Image

Load the DGN image using the Aspose.CAD library.

```java
DgnImage objImage = (DgnImage)Image.load(fileName);
```

## Step 4: Configure PDF Export Options

Set up options for exporting to PDF, including page dimensions, automatic layout scaling, background color, and specific layouts to export.

```java
PdfOptions options = new PdfOptions();
CadRasterizationOptions vectorOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
vectorOptions.setPageWidth(1500);
vectorOptions.setPageHeight(1500);
vectorOptions.setAutomaticLayoutsScaling(true);
vectorOptions.setBackgroundColor(Color.getBlack());
vectorOptions.setLayouts(new String[] { "1", "2", "3", "9" }); //only export 4 (1,2,3 and 9) views
options.setVectorRasterizationOptions(vectorOptions);
```

## Step 5: Save PDF File

Save the DGN image as a PDF file with the specified options.

```java
objImage.save(outFile, options);
```

Repeat these steps for different DGN files, adjusting file paths and options as needed.

## Conclusion

With Aspose.CAD for Java, converting DGN files to PDF becomes a straightforward process. This guide equips you with the knowledge to seamlessly integrate the library into your Java projects, facilitating efficient CAD file conversions.
