## Introduction
Welcome to this comprehensive guide on adding watermarks to CAD drawings using Aspose.CAD for Java. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate watermarks efficiently, enhancing your CAD documents with personalized messages or branding. Aspose.CAD for Java provides a powerful set of features, making the watermark addition process straightforward.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Aspose.CAD for Java: Make sure you have the Aspose.CAD library installed in your Java environment. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have the latest version of JDK installed on your system.
## Import Packages
In your Java project, import the necessary Aspose.CAD packages to get started:
```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.Cad3DPoint;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.CadMText;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects.CadText;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
```
## Step 1: Add New MTEXT
```java
//add new MTEXT
CadMText watermark = new CadMText();
watermark.setText("Watermark message");
watermark.setInitialTextHeight(40);
watermark.setInsertionPoint(new Cad3DPoint(300, 40));
watermark.setLayerName("0");
cadImage.getBlockEntities().get_Item("*Model_Space").addEntity(watermark);
```
## Step 2: Add Simple Entity like Text
You can also add a more straightforward entity like text:
```java
// or add more simple entity like Text
CadText text = new CadText();
text.setDefaultValue("Watermark text");
text.setTextHeight(40);
text.setFirstAlignment(new Cad3DPoint(300, 40));
text.setLayerName("0") ;
cadImage.getBlockEntities().get_Item("*Model_Space").addEntity(text);
```
## Step 3: Export to PDF
Export the CAD drawing with the added watermark to a PDF file:
```java
// export to pdf
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setLayouts(new String[]{"Model"});
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
cadImage.save(dataDir + "AddWatermark_out.pdf", pdfOptions);
//ExEnd:AddWatermark
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully added watermarks to your CAD drawings using Aspose.CAD for Java. This simple yet powerful process allows you to personalize your designs or protect them with branding.
