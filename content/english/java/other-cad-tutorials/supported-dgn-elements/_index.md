## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step tutorial on handling DGN (Design) elements using Aspose.CAD for Java. Aspose.CAD is a powerful Java library that allows you to work with CAD files efficiently. In this tutorial, we will focus on supported DGN elements and guide you through the process of handling them with Aspose.CAD.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your system.
2. Aspose.CAD Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).
3. Document Directory: Prepare a directory to store your DGN documents.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages to use Aspose.CAD functionalities:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.dgn.DgnElementType;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.dgn.DgnImage;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.dgn.dgnelements.DgnDrawingElementBase;
```

Now, let's break down the provided code into multiple steps for a clearer understanding:

## Step 1: Set Document Directory

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ExportingDGN/";
```

Ensure to replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path to your document directory.

## Step 2: Define Input and Output Paths

```java
String fileName = "BlockRefDgn.dwg";
String outPath = "BlockRefDgn.dwg.pdf";
```

Specify the input DWG file name and the desired output PDF file name.

## Step 3: Load DGN Image

```java
DgnImage dgnImage = (DgnImage)Image.load(dataDir);
```

Load the DGN image using the Aspose.CAD `Image` class.

## Step 4: Iterate Through DGN Elements

```java
for (DgnDrawingElementBase element : dgnImage.getElements())
{
    switch (element.getMetadata().getType())
    {
        // Handle different DGN element types
        case DgnElementType.Line:
        case DgnElementType.Ellipse:
        case DgnElementType.Curve:
        // ... (other cases)
        {
            // Perform specific actions based on the element type
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

Iterate through each DGN element and perform actions based on its type.

## Step 5: Handle Supported 3D Entities

```java
case DgnElementType.SolidHeader3D:
case DgnElementType.Cone:
case DgnElementType.CellHeader:
{
    // Handle supported 3D entities
    break;
}
```

Specifically handle supported 3D entities within the DGN file.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to handle supported DGN elements using Aspose.CAD for Java. This guide provides a solid foundation for working with CAD files efficiently in your Java applications.
