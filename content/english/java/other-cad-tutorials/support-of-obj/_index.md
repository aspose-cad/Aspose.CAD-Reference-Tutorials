## Introduction
Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on leveraging the power of Aspose.CAD for Java to handle OBJ drawings effortlessly. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to work with OBJ files, import packages, and convert them into PDF format using the Aspose.CAD library. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this tutorial will walk you through the process, ensuring you harness the full potential of Aspose.CAD for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, let's ensure you have the necessary prerequisites in place:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your system. You can download the latest JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Aspose.CAD Library: Download the Aspose.CAD library for Java from the official [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/). Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose your preferred Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. Make sure it's set up and ready for Java development.
## Import Packages
Once you have the prerequisites in place, it's time to import the necessary packages into your Java project. Add the following import statement at the beginning of your Java file:
```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
```
Now that we have set the stage let's break down the example into multiple steps.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "OBJDrawings/";
```
Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path to the directory where your OBJ drawings are located.
## Step 2: Load OBJ Drawing
```java
Image cadDoc = Image.load(dataDir + "example-580-W.obj");
```
Load the OBJ drawing using the `Image.load` method.
## Step 3: Configure Rasterization Options
```java
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(cadDoc.getSize().getWidth());
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(cadDoc.getSize().getHeight());
```
Configure rasterization options, setting page width and height based on the dimensions of the loaded CAD document.
## Step 4: Set PDF Options
```java
PdfOptions CADf = new PdfOptions();
CADf.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
```
Set PDF options and associate the rasterization options.
## Step 5: Save as PDF
```java
cadDoc.save(dataDir + "example-580-W_custom.pdf", CADf);
```
Save the modified CAD drawing as a PDF file.
Repeat these steps for each OBJ drawing you want to convert.
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to use Aspose.CAD for Java to support OBJ drawings and convert them into PDF format. This powerful library provides developers with a seamless solution for CAD file manipulation in Java applications.
