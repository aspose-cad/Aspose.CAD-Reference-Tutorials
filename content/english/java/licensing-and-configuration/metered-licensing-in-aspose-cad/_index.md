## Introduction

Unlock the full potential of Aspose.CAD for Java with metered licensing! This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of setting up metered licensing, ensuring seamless integration and optimal utilization of this powerful Java library for Computer-Aided Design (CAD). From prerequisites to importing packages and executing examples, this tutorial covers it all.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the world of metered licensing with Aspose.CAD, make sure you have the following in place:

### Java Development Kit (JDK) Installation

Ensure that you have the latest version of Java Development Kit installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### Aspose.CAD for Java Library

Make sure to download and set up the Aspose.CAD for Java library. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages to start using Aspose.CAD functionalities. Use the following code snippet to add metered licensing to your project:

```java
import com.aspose.cad;
```

## Step 1: Set Metered Key

Firstly, set the metered key using the `setMeteredKey` method. Replace `<valid public key>` and `<valid private key>` with your actual public and private keys.

```java
Metered.setMeteredKey("<valid public key>", "<valid private key>");
```

## Step 2: Get Consumption Quantity Before Processing

Retrieve the consumed quantity value before accessing the Aspose.CAD API to get an initial understanding.

```java
BigDecimal quantityOld = Metered.getConsumptionQuantity();
System.out.println("Consumption quantity before processing: " + quantityOld);
```

## Step 3: Processing

Perform your desired CAD processing using Aspose.CAD functionalities. Uncomment the code snippet related to your specific task, such as loading a CAD image.

```java
// Example:
// com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage image =
// (com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage)com.aspose.cad.Image.load("BlockRefDgn.dwg");
```

## Step 4: Get Consumption Quantity After Processing

After processing, obtain the consumed quantity value again to assess the impact.

```java
BigDecimal quantity = Metered.getConsumptionQuantity();
System.out.println("Consumption quantity after processing: " + quantity);
```

Repeat these steps for any additional processing or tasks as needed.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully mastered metered licensing with Aspose.CAD for Java. By following this guide, you've set up and integrated metered licensing seamlessly into your Java project, ensuring efficient usage of Aspose.CAD capabilities.
