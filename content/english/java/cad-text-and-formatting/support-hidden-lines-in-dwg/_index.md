## Introduction

Welcome to a comprehensive guide on leveraging Aspose.CAD for Java to enhance your DWG file manipulation capabilities. In this tutorial, we'll focus on a specific aspect: supporting hidden lines in DWG files. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this guide will help you navigate through the process with step-by-step instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.CAD for Java: Make sure you have the library installed. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

2. Your DWG Files: Have the DWG files you intend to work with ready in your document directory.

3. Java Development Environment: Set up a Java development environment on your machine.

Now that you're set up, let's delve into the details.

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your Java project. This ensures that you have access to the functionalities provided by Aspose.CAD.

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
```

Now, let's break down each step.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Ensure you have created a Java project and added Aspose.CAD to your dependencies.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "DWGDrawings/";
```

Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path to your document directory.

## Step 2: Load DWG File

Specify the path of your DWG file and create a `CadImage` object.

```java
String sourceFilePath = dataDir + "Bottom_plate.dwg";
String outPath = dataDir + "Bottom_plate.pdf";
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.load(sourceFilePath);
```

## Step 3: Configure Rasterization Options

Define the layers you want to include in the rasterization process.

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("Print","L1_RegMark","L2_RegMark");
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(cadImage.getHeight());
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(cadImage.getWidth()) ;
rasterizationOptions.setLayers(list);
```

## Step 4: Set PDF Options

Configure PDF options, including vector rasterization settings.

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setLayouts(new String[] { "Model" });
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
```

## Step 5: Save the Result

Save the processed DWG file as a PDF.

```java
cadImage.save(outPath, pdfOptions);
System.out.println("\nThe DWG file exported successfully to PDF.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented hidden lines support for DWG files using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Conclusion

This tutorial has walked you through the process of supporting hidden lines in DWG files using Aspose.CAD for Java. By following these steps, you can enhance your application's capabilities in handling CAD drawings with ease.
