## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.CAD for Java, a powerful library that empowers developers to manipulate CAD drawings effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll dive into creating single PDFs with different layouts using Aspose.CAD for Java. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this step-by-step guide will walk you through the process.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
- Aspose.CAD Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD library for Java from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).
- Document Directory: Set up a directory for your DWG drawings.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages:

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.SizeF;
import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.VectorRasterizationOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load CAD Drawing

Begin by loading your CAD drawing into a `CadImage` object:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "DWGDrawings/";
CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.load(dataDir + "City skyway map.dwg");
```

## Step 2: Configure Rasterization Options

Set up the rasterization options for the CAD image:

```java
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1000);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1000);
```

## Step 3: Customize Layout Page Sizes

Define custom sizes for several layouts within the CAD drawing:

```java
rasterizationOptions.getLayoutPageSizes().addItem("ANSI C Plot", new SizeF(500, 1000));
rasterizationOptions.getLayoutPageSizes().addItem("8.5 x 11 Plot", new SizeF(1000, 100));
```

## Step 4: Set PDF Options

Configure PDF options, incorporating the rasterization settings:

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
```

## Step 5: Save as PDF

Save the processed CAD image as a PDF:

```java
cadImage.save(dataDir + "singlePDF_out.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

Congratulations! You've successfully created a single PDF with different layouts using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the seamless integration of Aspose.CAD for Java to generate PDFs with diverse layouts from CAD drawings. The library's flexibility and robust features make it a go-to choice for CAD manipulation tasks.
