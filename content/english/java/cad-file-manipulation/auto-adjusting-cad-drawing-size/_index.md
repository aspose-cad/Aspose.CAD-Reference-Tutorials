## Introduction

In the world of CAD (Computer-Aided Design), adjusting drawing sizes is a common requirement, and with Aspose.CAD for Java, it becomes a seamless process. This powerful library provides comprehensive tools for handling CAD files in Java applications. In this tutorial, we will explore the step-by-step process of auto-adjusting CAD drawing sizes using Aspose.CAD.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

2. Aspose.CAD Library: Download and install the Aspose.CAD library for Java from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

3. Sample CAD File: Have a sample CAD file (e.g., sample.dwg) available in your document directory.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java application, include the necessary namespaces to utilize Aspose.CAD functionality. Here's an example:

```java

import com.aspose.cad.Image;
import com.aspose.cad.ImageOptionsBase;

import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PngOptions;
```

Now, let's break down the process of auto-adjusting CAD drawing sizes into manageable steps.

## Step 1: Load the CAD Drawing

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "CADConversion/";
String sourceFilePath = dataDir + "sample.dwg";
Image objImage = Image.load(sourceFilePath);
```

This step involves loading the CAD drawing from the specified file path.

## Step 2: Create BmpOptions

```java
BmpOptions bmpOptions = new BmpOptions();
```

Instantiate the `BmpOptions` class, which will be used to set various options for BMP format.

## Step 3: Create CadRasterizationOptions

```java
CadRasterizationOptions cadRasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
bmpOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(cadRasterizationOptions);
```

Create an instance of `CadRasterizationOptions` to customize rasterization settings for the CAD file.

## Step 4: Set Layouts Property

```java
cadRasterizationOptions.setLayouts(new String[]{"Model"});
```

Specify the layouts you want to include in the output. In this case, we use the "Model" layout.

## Step 5: Export to BMP Format

```java
String outPath = sourceFilePath + ".bmp";
objImage.save(outPath, bmpOptions);
```

Finally, save the adjusted CAD drawing in BMP format to the specified output path.

Repeat these steps in your Java application, and you'll have successfully auto-adjusted the CAD drawing size using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've walked through the process of auto-adjusting CAD drawing sizes using Aspose.CAD for Java. This library simplifies CAD file manipulation, providing a robust solution for developers.
