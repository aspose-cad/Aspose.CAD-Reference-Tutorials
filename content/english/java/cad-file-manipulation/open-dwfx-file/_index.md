## Introduction

In the fast-evolving world of technology, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files play a crucial role in various industries. Aspose.CAD for Java emerges as a powerful tool that empowers developers to manipulate CAD files efficiently. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the process of opening a DWFX file and converting it to a PDF using Aspose.CAD for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.CAD for Java Library: Ensure you have the Aspose.CAD library integrated into your Java project. If not, you can download it from the [Aspose.CAD for Java download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/java/).

- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.

- DWFX File: You'll need a DWFX file to follow along with the tutorial. If you don't have one, you can use a sample DWFX file for testing.

## Import Namespaces

In this step, we'll import the necessary namespaces to kickstart our project.

```java
import com.aspose.cad.Image;

import com.aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.CadImage;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions;
import com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
```

## Convert DWFX to PDF using Aspose.CAD for Java

Now, let's break down the process of opening a DWFX file and converting it to a PDF into multiple steps.

### Step 1: Load DWFX File

```java
String SourceDir = Utils.getDataDir_DWFXDrawings();
String OutputDir = Utils.getDataDir_Output();
String filePath = SourceDir + "Tyrannosaurus.dwfx";

Image cadImageDwf = Image.load(filePath);
```

In this step, we load the DWFX file using the `Image.load` method.

### Step 2: Set Rasterization Options

```java
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(cadImageDwf.getSize().getWidth());
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(cadImageDwf.getSize().getHeight());
```

Configure rasterization options for the CAD file, ensuring proper page width and height.

### Step 3: Configure PDF Options

```java
PdfOptions CADf = new PdfOptions();
CADf.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
```

Set up PDF options and associate rasterization options with the PDF configuration.

### Step 4: Save as PDF

```java
cadImageDwf.save(OutputDir + "OpenDwfxFile_out.pdf", CADf);
```

Save the converted PDF file to the specified output directory.

### Step 5: Verify Success

```java
System.out.println("OpenDwfxFile executed successfully");
```

Print a success message to confirm that the DWFX to PDF conversion process has been executed without errors.

## Conclusion

Aspose.CAD for Java provides a seamless solution for working with CAD files, offering developers the flexibility to convert DWFX files to PDF effortlessly. By following this step-by-step guide, you've unlocked the potential of Aspose.CAD for Java in handling CAD files efficiently.
